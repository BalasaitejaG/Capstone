"Apple AirPods Wireless Ear Buds, Bluetooth Headphones with Lightning Charging Case Included, Over 24 Hours of Battery Life, Effortless Setup for iPhone",B07PXGQC1Q,"Product works well. But we pay a price for the Apple brand. For fun, I purchased the highest rated non Apple EarPods on Amazon for $6.99 to compare. I am sure there's a technical difference, but they work fine and I can't tell the difference. If I assume the production cost of the ones I bought is 50% of the sales prise, then it's $3.5. Apple claims they user better components so let's say their cost if 50% higher, ie ~$5.

However, one day the right earpiece just quit working completely. No sound comes out of it at all. After a little internet research, it's apparent that there is some sort of defect that causes this problem. Hope that your headphones are in warranty. If it has been more than a year they will not discuss the issue with you and will merely send you to contractors that tell you there is nothing they can do. The closest 'service center' is about an 8 hour drive from where I live in NYC. That service center forces you to pay for shipping both ways and states a flat fee of at least 90 dollars to perform any work. They won't discuss any details with you at all. Clearly SONY is not a company that stands behind their products. They clearly have set up their customer service centers to be more atuned to legal liability than customer service. Really bad service.

"Sony WH1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Headphones, Wireless Bluetooth Over the Ear Headset ‚Äì Black (2018 Version)",B07G4MNFS1,"The headphones effectively block out ambient noise, making them perfect for travel or noisy environments. The sound quality is exceptional, with rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The comfortable, over-the-ear design and plush ear cups ensure extended wear without discomfort. Wireless Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, offering convenience and freedom from tangled cords. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing easy adjustment of volume, tracks, and calls. The touch-sensitive controls, while innovative, can sometimes be overly sensitive or unresponsive, leading to accidental changes in volume or track. The headphones are also relatively expensive, which may be a barrier for budget-conscious consumers. Some might find the design to be bulky, making them less portable than smaller, more compact options. While the battery life is impressive, extended use of noise cancellation can drain it faster than expected.","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024",mr newyork,0,True,5.0 out of 5 stars,Immersive audio experience with superior noise-cancellation technology,R2WAYROROSJZ9N,21712,4.6 out of 5

I can honestly say I've gotten my money's worth out of them over the past 5 years. I replaced the foam cups once during that time. It seems those last about 3 years and are reasonable to replace. However, I've always been concerned with the plastic build, especially around the slide cover where you can adjust cup distance. I know others have had that part break in less time. Mine lasted just over 5 years before fully giving out and snapping into pieces. And I always transported them in the case they come in. It's convenient and protects them. Maybe that's how they lasted as long. Either way, it's a bummer they broke, but I'm only taking away one star for it since 5 years feels like an acceptable length of time to me.

Pros: everything is easy to use and actually works when you want it to. To have a piece of electronic equipment not have A SINGLE ISSUE in over 3 years is unheard of. The sound quality is amazing. I can hear every piece of the drum kit clearly and all the notes from the guitar. I also use the noise canceling option on planes and when annoying people are near me. The Bluetooth is a breeze everytime and I haven't had any audio drop outs or calls dropped. Solid headset if you want to rock out to some metal or chill out to chill beats. It has to be the best headset in this price range and durability is unparalleled. I love that the button on the left ear tells you how much battery life is left. I haven't had these lose charge or cabalitiy to charge. It is insane the quality. I have been getting lower quality things for so long that these really made a good impression.
