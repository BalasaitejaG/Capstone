https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/review/R24287YSZV8A1Z/,Action Camera,5,"This tiny action camera from Campark is really the dog's whats-its.These camera have become incredibly popular in recent times, as they are tiny and easy to carry everywhere. They are usually described as 'action camera' as they have fast shutter speeds and good video quality to allow you to catch fast moving subjects in sports.Most of these (cheaper) cameras I have seen have been ok, but stuck with 1080p resolution and cheap back screens with confusing buttons. This all singing, all dancing model is different.You can take 4K video (only at 24 fps though), and the stills can go up to 20 MP. And best of all, the back screen is finally a touch screen, which makes navigating the menus so much easier.The camera does not come with any storage on board, or an SD card, but micro SD cards are really cheap these days, so it shouldn't matter too much.As I said, you can take still pictures up 20 20MP, which makes them great for landscape shots as you can zoom in with minimal loss of detail. The video quality is ok, but 4K at 24 fps is not as good as 1080p at 50 fps (in my opinion). I have tried to include a sample of both for comparison, but Amazon will only allow one video per review. The video of the dogs is 1080 at 50 fps. The photos are both 20 MP.You get a nice semi hard case, plus a massive amount of accessories, mounts, sticky pads, and a fully waterproof case for shooting underwater. However, when the camera is in this case, you obviously cannot access the touch screen, but the button on the front allows you to cycle through all the modes, so minimal problems there. You also get a little remote control unit.The battery with the camera is only 150 mAh, so it might be an idea to take 2 or 3 along for a day's fun. Other cameras I have tried of this type have come with a spare battery in the case, so a bit disappointing not to receive a spare here. Charging the battery took about 2 hours.To get the photos off the camera, you can take the SD card out and stick it in your computer, or WiFi transfer is included. To use the WiFi with your phone is a bit complicated (well it was for me anyway). You have to create a new wifi connection to the camera, then download the 'CamKing' app (for Android, not sure about iOS), and view your pics on your phone. You can then download them to your phone, and finally I uploaded them to Google Photos to access them on the computer.

The longest track, ""Song of Myself"", is unusual in that fact that half of it is spoken.The second disc, like ""Dark Passion Play"", are instrumental versions.

I've used earbuds regularly for over a months while exercising, while working in landscaping/farming, and presently as an attorney. The different types of work affect sound quality, given the types of ambient noise one experiences, the jostling of the headphones from movement, etc. In addition, I only buy headphones that are no more than £100, preferably less than £10, because I have a tendency to lose and/or destroy them. These are, hands down, the best pair I've ever had, even better than the £100 Beats I used to buy. The fit is perfect, they do not jostle around in your ear, and because the fit is so snug (without being annoying), they eliminate ambient noise extremely well. For example, on a plane you barely notice the engine sound (relative to any other headphones I've owned).And the sound quality is the best I've ever experienced by long shot for a pair of earbuds. The bass is deep and full, mids are actually pronounced, and the treble is not piercing like it is frequently in earbuds. The clarity for something like jazz is not perfect if your an audiophile, but still better than anything else at this price point, or at numerous price points above it.NOTE: In order to maximize sound quality, you have to use the rubber piece that fits snugly into your ear.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/review/R8LJ0YBBL275X/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8,So nearly perfect! A welcome record of a much-loved show.,4,"Review of double-disc blu-ray set.Saw the original at Drury Lane once - not that impressed. Saw the 2014 production, as seen here, and saw it again and again - such an improvement in terms of pace, staging, you name it! Day seats meant that I was on the front row of the stalls numerous times for just £20 - brilliant!And now we have the film of the show. I saw it at the cinema. For some reason, the volume was so low that you could hear the subwoofers from the action movies on other screens, not to mention the munching of popcorn and slurping of drinks, so I'm looking forward to watching this movie on my terms!OK - it's a brilliant record of a brilliant show. The cinematography is superb. The only fault I can find is that editing room floor must have been littered with the footage filmed from the static cameras that must have been there on the night of the 25th Anniversary Performance. Cameras that must have filmed the stage as a whole. One of the reasons I loved this production was that the stage was used to its full extent. You could look left and right and see other stuff. ""Dressing the stage"", I believe. When Alistair Brammer is giving his truly stupendous rendition of ""Why God Why"" stage left, there is a wonderfully understated bar scene stage right. I mean, I'm not complaining that the camera spent a lot of time on close-ups of Mr Brammer during this scene, but the atmosphere the bar actually adds is lost. During ""What a Waste"", there is action everywhere - a few wide shots would have been very welcome. Almost nothing of the go-go boy as he teases the Mormon - one of the funniest parts of the show. Instead, to put across the delightful mayhem of this scene, there are lots of, well, close-ups. Superimposed. Moving across the screen like those old films of firework displays where they tried to cram as many actual bursts of stars as they could. I'd rather have a little more choice of where to look.Even in the final scene - the one which I thought was ruined by the addition of Ellen, the Engineer and John faffing about with Tam stage left, while (is this really a spoiler?) Chris bids farewell to Kim stage right - the film does a close up of Chris/Kim and all but ignores the others.It was a big theatre with a wide stage. The production team did a fantastic job filling the stage. That is sadly missing here.Rant over! There is plenty to praise in this film:There can be very little of the actual 25th Anniversary Performance left. Most of the shots are clearly from Steadycam on stage, which will have been filmed after the event. This actually makes the film more interesting, as swings and new cast members had joined the show. It was fun debating ""Well, I'm sure Niall was the Mormon at the start of 'What a Waste', but that wasn't him later on upstage with the pole dancers."" It was also great to see that all the cast members had their close-ups. A very nice touch.The colours are strangely muted - especially in Act II. For example, Ellen's hideous lemon-yellow dress (who thought that was a good idea?) looks almost sepia in the film and decidedly more tasteful as a result.The close-ups show the amazing performances being given. Eva Noblezada - a truly remarkable find - and Rachelle Ann Go express such a depth of emotion it truly has to be seen in close-up.I strongly recommend this film.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/review/R2X9CNHSIMN7GR/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8,A very good bike let down by small issues,3,"I have now had the bike a few weeks and I can say I'm very happy with it. The bike was easy to assemble and it's very sturdy and comfortable to use. Being 6ft 5in I had my reservations that it would be ergonomically designed for me to use for prolonged periods of time, but I'm happy to say I certainly can and I've found both the seat and the body position I use cause me no ill effects. The seat and the handle bars are fully adjustable to various hights whilst the seat can also be moved closer or further away from the handle bars for even greater comfort.Now the reason for the 3 stars: unfortunately I had to return my first bike within 24 hours due to it developing a high pitched squeak, I did try to ascertain where the problem was originating from but to no avail; most of the bikes workings are shielded in plastic preventing any attempt at lubricantion. The problem was delt with effectively via email with the company and I received a replacement within 3 days (Very good customer service)The second issue I have is that whilst the assembly instructions are clear and concise there are no instructions on how to use the accompanying display screen/ monitor. The monitor comes with various settings from distance cycled, calories burnt, time elapsed etc, there is also one for what I believe is a pre-programmable setting but without any information on how to program this a lot of guess work was/is involved before you can get the best out of your workout. One final comment about the monitor is that whilst the casing is large with a place to put a iPad/or phone etc the actual LCD display in very small if not minuscule which is rather a pity, it doesn't detract from being able to read the display but I do feel a larger LCD would be more beneficial.To summarise I do think the bike is worth investing your money in as without the squeak problem I experienced you will have a very good bike to use.

Don't get the grey one if you like chocolate!Like Liberatone's Zipp Mini, the One Style is labelled as 'Made for' Apple devices. Unlike the Zipp Mini though, AirPlay is not an option so Bluetooth levels the playing field somewhat. To get the most out of it though does require the Liberatone app, available from the Apple App Store and Google Play. There is also an aux input for mini headphone jack connections hidden under a rubber flap on the back, along side the mini-USB charging port. A charging lead is provided but no mains plug so you'll need to charge from a computer or use a separate adaptor. AptX Bluetooth does not appear to be supported, but Bluetooth 4.1 is so the 4G signal quality of a connected phone is not impaired.That rubber flap is important as the One Style is splash-proof, as also evidenced by the rubber strip that covers the edges and also provides the handle/hook on the corner. It's a nice looking device though the grey material covering the drivers is easily marked. Like if someone in your house picks it up while eating a Cadbury's Flake. Most of the chocolate marks came out but not all! If you do intend taking it out and about you might want to consider a darker colour.Once paired, from the Liberatone app you can play 5 preset radio stations, but these can't be selected from the device directly. You can also adjust the sound, choosing from an adjustment ranging from smooth jazz to rock. Otherwise select your music app of choice and off you go. The sound comes out of both sides of the One Style but each side sounds slightly different: the front (with the volume and control dial) has more of the midrange and bass while the rear has more of the treble.This can be a little strange at first. I found the most balanced sound came with the One Style sitting edge-on facing me but it then feels like it's not playing 'to' you. Putting it on a shelf with the rear wall to bounce the sound off worked better. There is plenty of detail to the sound, decent bass and it goes pretty loud.

does not feel like it will tear easily.The material that is used looks like the same material they sometimes use to make hammock's out of.The main stitching around the bottom sides of the cover does not look very well sewn but the stitching around the elasticated front and back part of the cover does look a lot better as does any other stitching on the rest of the car cover.I personally got this Matcc car cover to use mainly over winter when expecting ice or snow so I haven't been able to try it out properly yet in that type of condition but since using it I have been impressed with it.I am using the Matcc car cover with a Kia Venga with the cover fitting over the car nicely.The front and back of the car cover at the bottom of it is elasticated so it fits nice and snuggly around the front and back of your car.The cover has four ties sewn on to it that line up with the wheels of your car so the cover can be tied down to each wheel, there is also a long strap that is sewn to the car cover that lines up to the middle of your car.This strap goes underneath your car and attaches to the other side of the car cover to hold it down even more securely.It only takes a couple of minutes to put the car cover on to your car and tie it down and even less time to remove it.The only awkward part is placing the main strap underneath your car but having a long stick or pole helps push the strap underneath the car.Another nice feature of this Matcc car cover is it has two pockets on it that the door mirrors fit in to.There are also reflective strips on the front and back of the cover as well as the door mirror pockets.So far I have been impressed with this Mattcc car cover but it is not perfect apart from the sewing on the bottom sides of the car cover the ties that go

To take full advantage of the features offered by these devices, the demand for digital storage space has increased more and more over the years.I bought the huge 32GB Lexar memory card for my smartphone. A the time, this had double the storage capacity of my device. It was the most cost effective way of 'upgrading' your phone.For any given memory device, there are two speed specifications that you need to bear in mind, namely, the read and write speed. The faster the read speed the more rapid is the rate of data transfer to your computer. The higher the write speed the faster the images are saved onto the memory card. A Class 2 speed translates to write speeds of 2MB per sec. This is the sustained writing speed as opposed to the maximum instantaneous write speed, the number shown on the memory card. Therefore a class 10 card will achieve 10MB/sec.I have not experienced any problems with data corruption when using trusted brands like, Lexar. You also receive a good quality card reader. It is worth noting the image quality is unaffected by the type of memory card used. However using a low speed (say class 2) will process the information more slowly. It may also be less reliable and may corrupt you data more readily when used in high demanding applications.I purchased this item at full price.

The town had all the usual shops, such as Marks and Spencer, and was relatively smart.I knew it had become a run down and the home of Karen Mathews, but took my car to a tyre fitter there a year ago as they had a tyre in stock. Whilst my tyre was being done,I strolled through Dewsbury for the first time in maybe 20 years, and was shocked at what I saw, many of the shops and even McDonalds closed down. I saw a group of drunks fighting in the town square (middle of the day). I was approached by someone who appeared to have serious psychiatric issues. The people looked poor and dejected. Pound stores, ?never never? on the tick type shops and various Asian speciality shops seemed the order of the day. Even the market was a shadow of its former self and I heard just the other week that a famous Pork butchers had shut up shop after around 100 years or more. It was basically horrible, one of the worst towns I had ever walked though. How sad I felt.I saw this book and wondered if it would cast some light on how a once nice town had become this. The rather quick death of the place had sort of passed me by, I would like some answers.The book explains the cultural split in a Dewsbury with people living in alternate universe in places like Saville Town, and the lack of integration between communities. The author seems to think this is a big part of the town?s downfall. He also explains the political climate, and how certain entities ceased control and imposed an agenda, to the detriment of many Dewsbury residents.Im not convinced the book is that well written and sometimes seems rambling and flitting between different subjects.

I felt her worth persevering with though so was interested to read her latest - it's less than 200 pages so shouldn't be too much of a problem!Actually.

The Prisme range create interesting effects on their own, but when you combine them with the Vitrail range, you can get a huge range of effects. The Prisme range are opaque, so are not ideal for glass painting where you intend to illuminate the object from behind, such as a votive holder or something to hang in the window, but when combined with the transparent Vitrail products you can get the best of both worlds. The basic Prisme effect reminds me of looking at cells through a microscope. Tiny circles form around the ""seed"" particles in the paint - the thickness of the layer of paint appears to affect the size of these circles.One small point - when it says ""Stir well before use"" it means it! The stuff in the paint that acts as the ""seed"" for the effect needs to be distributed well, otherwise you'll get some early work that has loads of the little ""blobs"" and your later work will have fewer and fewer.As for the Discovery collections from Pebeo, I'd recommend them every time if you want to try out a new range.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/review/RQ8AHUH63URV4/ref=pdp_new_read_full_review_link?ie=UTF8,Tries to understand without judging,5,"The observation of youth culture is not a topic I would normally read about and many novels tackling this subject would tend to be marketed as YA novels. However, this book was highly recommended as a book which should be read by all people so I was curious.It's almost 300 pages split into 39 chapters.Gang culture doesn't touch my life on a day to day basis so it is easy to dismiss it as nothing but a curse to society, however anyone who is prepared to invest time in a book like this is looking for so much more and the author gives us that.It is clear that Polly Courtney has researched the world she is using and she appears to get into the minds of the various gang members involved in the story.Initially it's difficult to get used to the authentic language that is used but the glossary at the front really helps - within a few chapters I felt quite at ease with the dialogue. This makes the story feel very real as you manage to get into Alesha's head and start to understand her distrust of the unknown. I really got a feel for the immediate way that she runs her life with no thought for the future.The process of reading this book is hard as it forces you to challenge your own opinions of Alesha. We see how she makes her decisions about what is the truth and how she applies her prejudice to her judgements. The difficult part for the reader is to think about what you would do, given her background and her limited access to resources.Her teacher edges towards being a cliche but she is used well and serves an important role in the plot in providing an alternative view for Alesha to considerIt's very hard for most people to sympathise with those involved in gang culture - this book does not judge the gang members but tries to understand, which is the best that all of us can do.

However, this book was highly recommended as a book which should be read by all people so I was curious.It's almost 300 pages split into 39 chapters.Gang culture doesn't touch my life on a day to day basis so it is easy to dismiss it as nothing but a curse to society, however anyone who is prepared to invest time in a book like this is looking for so much more and the author gives us that.It is clear that Polly Courtney has researched the world she is using and she appears to get into the minds of the various gang members involved in the story.Initially it's difficult to get used to the authentic language that is used but the glossary at the front really helps - within a few chapters I felt quite at ease with the dialogue. This makes the story feel very real as you manage to get into Alesha's head and start to understand her distrust of the unknown. I really got a feel for the immediate way that she runs her life with no thought for the future.The process of reading this book is hard as it forces you to challenge your own opinions of Alesha. We see how she makes her decisions about what is the truth and how she applies her prejudice to her judgements. The difficult part for the reader is to think about what you would do, given her background and her limited access to resources.Her teacher edges towards being a cliche but she is used well and serves an important role in the plot in providing an alternative view for Alesha to considerIt's very hard for most people to sympathise with those involved in gang culture - this book does not judge the gang members but tries to understand, which is the best that all of us can do. I found myself becoming angry and frustrated by her life which shows how strong the character was to me.To read this book then you'll have to have a curiosity about gang culture and, if you have, then you'll find this book fascinating and very rewarding. I hope that this novel will make you question your beliefs as it did with me."

The other thing I like is that it's very easy to clean. Each of the parts in contact with food (cup/jug, blade, lid and seal) can be removed and rinsed or washed. The other parts don't get dirty at all. It makes about three quarters of a litre of slush/soup/whatever, and is a reasonable size for putting away in the drawer. I like it."
