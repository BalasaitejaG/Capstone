"I recently purchased the Xbox Series S from Amazon, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision! The console offers an incredible gaming experience at a very affordable price point. Setting it up was a breeze, and the sleek, compact design fits perfectly in my setup without taking much space.The performance is top-notch, with fast load times thanks to the SSD. Games run smoothly, and the graphics are stunning, even without 4K. I’ve been able to dive right into popular titles like Forza Horizon and Halo Infinite with no lag or issues. The quick resume feature is a game-changer—it allows me to switch between multiple games effortlessly!Game Pass is another big win. It’s like having a vast library of games at my fingertips, making the value of this console unbeatable. If you're looking for a next-gen console with smooth gameplay and excellent features, the Xbox Series S is the way to go!Highly recommended ! Five stars all the way!",5,13/10/24,xbox_seriesS,6 people found this helpful
"I loved the Xbox Series S gaming console. The reason why I bought this console in 2021 was Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. A few things that I like about this console are:1. Small Size of the console: You can carry this console with you wherever you want by just putting it in your backpack. Yes, the size is so small. Also, I have carried it in flights in both Carry on and Checked luggage (with proper packing) and it works perfectly fine. So, the build is pretty sturdy.2. Smoothness of the games: I haven't had any problems with the smoothness of the gameplay. However, I have only played a few games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, Forza Horizon 4 and 5, Grand Theft Auto GTA 5, Assetto Corsa etc. So, this should provide you with some idea about its capability. It doesn't support 4K, so keep that in mind.3. Controller: Still works great after 3 years, just put the XBOX recommended Lithium ion battery in it. That should last 1-2 days (daily 4-6 hours of usage) depending upon the game play. Also, battery still works great after three years.4. Game Pass: Get the subscription you may like and it provides you with adequate number of games, else you can buy the games you want to play separately.5. Storage: This is the only negative with this console and that too in a big way. The reason is, after regular game updates, I could not keep and play both the MS flight simulator 2020 and Forza Horizon 5. It only offers 512 GBs of storage of which approximately 350 GBs in available for game storage. Although FS 2024 has been released and is comparatively very small in size but its game play is heavily reliant on the internet connection. So, keep the storage capacity in mind. You can get official Xbox Series S|X storage to upgrade memory but that's expensive.6. HOTAS & Racing Wheel: HOTAS for MS Flight Simulator, designed for Xbox, work well. However, I experienced compatibility issues with my Thrustmaster racing wheel, where the steering wheel would lose feedback upon waking up the console etc. See my separate review for Thrustmaster racing wheel for more details.",5,22/12/24,xbox_seriesS,9 people found this helpful
"I think Microsoft has nailed it with the affordable offering of their next gen console. This compact little thing is a BEAST of a performer to say the least. For someone coming from a PS4 console, I just loved the blazing fast performance it offers compared to the Price and Specs it hasAfter nearly 100 Hrs of gaming on this white beauty here's my honest take on it:PROS:1) Price ( For the same performance out of a PC, be ready to shell out atleast 70 to 80K)2) Super Fast SSD.3) QUick resume function is a blessing really.4) With Game pass, You get access to a library of games so vast that you can never play it all.5) Ray Tracing........It blows my mind as to how this thing supports ray tracing with such humble specs. But it does and how. The graphics look absolutely stunning even on a 4k TV despite the fact that It supports a native resolution of only 1440P.6) The most portable gaming console ever. You can literally carry it in ur luggage wherever you go. which is exactly what m planning to do.7) Supports external HDD (USB 3.0 type) to overcome space restrictions on it's internal SSD. And infact Older generation games like Battlefield 4, Moto GP 20, PUBG etc can actually be played directly from the HDD without transferring it to the Internal storage....AWESOMEEE..8) Whisper quiet and cool : even after 4 hours straight of intense gaming, you cannot hear the fan working even in a sound proof room. It's that silent. And the Heat management is some sort of magic trick...It was barely warm to touch.9) Like previous generation XBOX, this one supports keyboard and mouse set ups for a limited few games.10) If you have a 1080p HD TV ...just close ur eyes and go for it rather than spending a bomb on more powerful consoles. And even for those with 4K TV...Trust me...at 10 feet away, your eyes cannot tell the difference between 1440P and 4K. moreover none of the TVs commonly available in the market today support more than 60hz refresh rate which means you'll never actually be able to explore the 120FPS capability of even this console, let alone the higher spec ones.CONS:1) The 500 GB SSD with just about 364 GB of available space ( For those who don't wanna read point no 7 above :)...)2) The controller isn't as exciting as the Dualsense controller of PS5 or even dual shock of PS4.3) No inbuilt battery in the controller. ( I simply ordered panasonic eneloop rechargeable batteries..problem solved)4) Might not suite you if you love to have a game disk collection.5) Doesn't support HDR or HDR 10+ on 1080P TVs. ( Not a deal breaker)I realized i had to really think hard for those CONS ....that's how good this machine is. If you are someone looking to step into the amazing world of console gaming and don't wanna spend a bomb. Just go for it'",5,14/01/21,xbox_seriesS,70 people found this helpful
"I have been using mine for 10 daysSo my setup :Video : 3 screens (old Samsung 720p TV, Sony Bravia 34 inch 1080p tv and a Samsung monitor 21 inch 1080p)Audio : Sony MDR XB 450 APGames tested : Forza Horizon 4, Doom Eternal, Halo MCC, The Touryst, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Borderlands 3, Crysis 3, Black, Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, Tetris Effect and No Man's SkySo Series S has been touted as a budget gamer setup. Let me break down the ""budget"" bit hereConsole : 34k with discount in my caseDisplay : 1080p monitor 8kSo one time cost = 42k (not exactly budget, but gaming ain't cheap and I can assure you that at this point in time a PC giving a similar performance will not be possible to make for 42k INR in India at least, not the phrase at this point in time please)Recurring expenses :Xbox Gamepass Ultimate = 824/ month (gives you access to over 300 games on both PC and console including likes of Halo, Forza Horizon, Gears of War) annualizing to around 9900. NOTE : You can choose not to opt for this but Iam telling you, this is the best deal in gaming period.Fibre Internet : JioFiber annual is 8400 per year for 100 MbpsSo recurring expenses = 18300/ yearPlus there will be expenses related to non gamepass games you buy (all Ubisoft titles for example)If and only if these numbers sound feasible to you, even consider the Series S, you want no compromise and exclusives ? PS5 Digital or Disc and the Series X should be your choiceNow coming to the system itself, you have seen how tiny and portable it is. Is it powerful ? Oh yes ! Any game optimized for Series S|X runs 1080p 60 fps without a hitch. After many years of tweaking around with .ini files, the ability to just download and play is a huge relief.Also its fast, I don't sit on my console for longer than 1.5 hours a day . The system can resume from where you left off (even after switching off and then on, although this is not yet flawless) which further encourages a more play leave resume style, perfect for people like me. Also the loading times are frankly insane, levels in Doom Eternal for example load in around 8 to 15 seconds. Additionally as it basically runs a tweaked version of Windows you can run a browser (Edge) and other apps (Netflix, Amazon Prime) as well. So its a compact entertainment system.One major shortcoming is the frankly anemic storage on board at 364 GB (yikes), my suggestion is to get a external SSD or USB 3.1 hard drive to use as a pack mule for games. I have done the sameOverall in the first week of usage, no major crashes, quick resume is still not flawless but awesome when it works and a smooth gaming experience for all the money stated above.Hope this helps you guys !",4,23/11/20,xbox_seriesS,39 people found this helpful

"I ordered it on 28th April and received it on 29th April (no complaints on Amazon delivery. It's amazing as it has always been)I was excited to experience it and set it up ASAP.The moment I take it out of the packaging, right off the bat, I could notice that it was not new. Even at this point, my elation got the better of me, and I ignored it.Here is the list of issues:1. Not a new Product - The main seal to open the box was taken off and pasted back because it came off so easily.2. United States variant (image attached) - On the cover, it says that it's only for the distribution within United States. It means that I cannot claim any warranty for this product if I face any issues in the future.3. United States Electric Outlet Plug (image attached) - This confirms my above point because that plug is practically useless in India. We do not have sockets built for that.4. No batteries with Controller - The AA battery always comes in a separate seal. It was missing. This again proves my 1st point that it’s not a new product.I never get to open the console because I do not see any point in doing that.The seller is 'Infinity Games'. Now, I have to spend days coordinating with the Amazon team to get this resolved and place the order again.Overall, there was hardly anything left to ruin the excitement and experience of owning a console.",1,30/04/23,xbox_seriesS,16 people found this helpful
its good product and amazon team helped throughout the process,5,03/01/25,xbox_seriesS,
It is a very powerful console for the price.  It has support for many games and gamepass makes it affordable to get games. It does have less storage but it is manageable,5,18/01/25,xbox_seriesS,
"My son loves it. Now he can play games that I have not heard about! Apparently these games were not available on XBox One. This device seems to have excellent heat dissipation abilities, evidenced by very hot air it spits out. It has limited storage capacity, though low storage capacity has been mitigated by 1TB external SSD I bought seperately. However, external storage can only be used to play older games, newer games can only be played if they are on built-in storage.This means you can store downloaded new updated games on external storage device but have to transfer it back to internal storage when wanting to play.  I guess that is not a big deal if you have the patience to wait for 5-10 minutes (Depending on the size of the game) before the game transfers from external to internal storage and is ready for play.",5,22/05/24,xbox_seriesS,One person found this helpful
"Yes the console is overpriced by 5k, and yes with 5k more you can get PS5 De. Firstly getting a pc with does Raytracing ( RT ) is almost impossible in India, let alone matching the specs & ssd of the console. Coming to PS argument, this console is meant for those who are casual gamers, who have 1080p tv/ monitor, who ain't willing to spend ₹5k for 1 game ( this price may increase as now PS games will cost $70 instead of previous 60 ). Paired with Game Pass ultimate subscription you can play a plethora of games on this powerful little console. Fun fact Game Pass Ultimate cost me 6k for 30 months and it includes Games like Fifa ( included in EA play which is now a part of Game pass ultimate). Note I got the subscription this cheap using the ₹60 promotion ( Buy xbox live gift card from Microsoft Store then use the ₹60 promotion to upgrade all those months of live to Game pass ultimate) Also all first party and xbox publishing games (Ex halo infinite,the medium, starfield etc )will be on Game pass on day one. And all first party games like doom, Gears of war, Halo, fallout, Batman Arkham knight and more games are already on Game pass. The ones who are defaming this powerful little console are either hardcore gamers who spend ₹20k + on games a year or people who are judging this console based on exclusive games. This game is perfect for a middle class man!Edit Quick resume is game changer! With help of it, I don't even encounter loading screens on games i play regularly ( Ac Valhalla in this case ). Also xbox with it's fps boost feature is doubling the frame rates of previous gen games which were locked at 30fps.PS5 doesn't have any counter to Quick resume or Fps boost, although you can obviously play previous gen games with uncap frames. Advice : Going with PC is better only if you can afford a strong PC, also please don't go for gaming laptops. PS5 exclusives like HZD, Death stranding, P4 and more ( Days gone ) are being ported to PC, so if you get a powerful PC you can play exclusive games of both Xbox and PS.If you are on budget then series S + Game pass ultimate is the way to go.",5,14/11/20,xbox_seriesS,99 people found this helpful

"Overall, I am happy with the Product.The console looks new and unused which is the basic requirement.But the seal was tampered which made the product look fishy to me. Like why was it broken?Also, I received Hong Kong version of Xbox and foreign power cord. That was not nice from the seller. Indian version would have been ideal.For those who receive this version, do not exchange. Instead, buy a separate power cord for Indian sockets. If exchanged, they will give a used product which is not ideal.Overall, you can buy this. Gameplay, everything else is perfect for Xbox which is on Microsoft and not the seller, lol.",4,23/10/23,xbox_seriesS,4 people found this helpful

"Cons :1. European plug 🔌 provided. Fits loose on Indian power sockets.2. Something frames drop / freeze while playing farcry 5. But its not common. Happened to 3/100 times3. Batteries run out pretty often. Better to get good quality rechargeable batteries.4. The console doesn't connect to any Bluetooth speaker or third party controllers wirelessly. Have to rely on your display unit for that.5. I wish more big and famous titles were added to game pass.6. Limited games support mouse and keyboard. Being a Microsoft device, i'd expect it to run all the pc games with MKB support, sadly that's not the case.So FPS gamers, don't even try. Stick to PC, consoles are catching up very very very slowly.Pros :1. This thing is big power-small package deal. Casual gamers, this is your go to. I have 5-7 titles at a time always installed and this thing handles it pretty well.(Farcry 5, Batman Arkham knight, AC origins, Watchdogs 2, Ghost recon, UFC 4, power wash) and i still have 120 gigs left, imagine.2. The fit and finish is phenomenal. This console is something you'd show off. The design is top notch and attention to detail is through the roof.3. Upscales to 4k. I play on a 55 inch tv, runs everything like flagship console. No compromises4. Affordablilty to charge the controller. You can charge the controller by three different ways - batteries, usb cable, xbox's controller dock.5. Fits anywhere. I carry it around with my laptop and tablet in my 40L backpack, and i'm still left with a lot of room for my other stuff.",5,23/08/22,xbox_seriesS,32 people found this helpful
Very nice 👍👍👍,5,06/10/24,xbox_seriesS,
"Just unboxed this beauty. I'll update the review once I get a chance to play games on this.Update: If you are new to console gaming or don't care about 4K etc just go for it. Remember you need to pay 3-4k for a base edition of AAA title. So if you're going to play in a monitor like me and want to try out new games this will be perfect for you. You can play 1080p-2k(mostly 30fps) on a 34k device and for some games you'll also get ray-tracing.** Is it worth? Should I buy a PC instead:If gaming(and netflix, prime video) is what you want to do then just check the prices of a octa core Ryzen cpu and 512GB pcie4 SSD. Also keep in mind that the GPU is based on AMD RDNA2 architecture.** Details:Usable storage 364GB. For reference ASC Valhalla standard edition takes 47GB on XSS(smart delivery).Graphics look awesome on a 24"" 1080p IPS monitor.UI & Opening games are blazing fast thanks to its SSD.Microsoft Game Pass is best deal if you want to play something all the time. It'll probably have few AAA games always available in the list. Currently they have Gears 5, Minecraft, FIFA 2020 etc.Controller is perfect without any ""gimicky"" feature. It has nice haptic feedback too. I personally like offset L and R button.If you're interested in hard-core shooter games then I think any console's controller is not for you.Final verdict: If you want to enjoy few good games on your free times mainly in weekends without compromising features(except 4k) this will perfectly suit you.",5,12/11/20,xbox_seriesS,124 people found this helpful
"This was delivered on the due date as promised. I hv been a PlayStation guy so far and this was my first MS console. I was skeptical knowing that there is no disk drive. But after using it for about two weeks, along with the game pass, I'm deeply satisfied. The gaming is as smooth as it gets and at a very reasonable cost. You do miss out on PlayStation exclusives like Spiderman and Uncharted and maybe few more, but the sheer choices at game pass make up for more than that.I'm a racing freak and my son is more of a combat gamer. We are both spoilt with choices and can't seem to focus on a single game. The monthly game pass i bought is valid for 8 months which is way more than I could have bargained for!!! There is a flip side though... I hv a 65"" smart tv and the pixels are at times not very clear. The game loading is at times slow. And due to the 364 GB storage you can store limited number of games. This doesn't bother me as much as my son as he likes to move from one game to another.But overall it's a great console with super smooth handling and features. No major complaints.One thing, ensure you have good internet connectivity to unleash the might of this console.",4,25/02/22,xbox_seriesS,2 people found this helpful
"First of all I would like to thank amazon for before time delivery...Hats off....I bought series s as series x are out of stock everywhere in india and I don't want to shill out double the MSRP to scalpers.At First i was skeptical whether this tiny machine can game properly  as this was my 1st console and I am a pc gamer mostly gaming at 1440p 60+ fps on my pc with RX 5700xt.But boy I was so wrong,the series S can basically do everything a series x can do but at 1080p.i paired it with a 4k monitor and the games look soo good....Internal 512gb ssd is small and you can only keep 2 or 3 AAA games max at a time before you run out of memory. The expansion card is pricey so I am waiting for the price to drop in future meanwhile I have connected a 4TB external hdd to it to play all previous gen games..One of of the best feature that distinguish a XBOX Series X/S from a playstion is the game pass where for a low monthly you can enjoy hundreds of game.Playstation doesn't have this  even if you subscribe to PS+ trust me I have them both.PS 5 does have some good games but they are handfull but with gamepass you virtually have all previous gen xbox game to play with game pass subscription.Series x/s optimized games can only be installed on internal ssd or Seagate expansion card but for all other games you can install on external hard drive..Console games are expensive then PC unless they are on sale so if you want to game more and pay less I will advice you to go with series s with gamepass...Happy Gaming",5,04/12/21,xbox_seriesS,3 people found this helpful
"Bought this over 10 days ago. This is a brilliant little gaming box at a very affordable price. I was initially skeptical of the purchase coz it's not as powerful as the Xbox series X or PS5 but then again, this isn't targeted for 4k gaming. Honestly, I don't know a lot of people who are into 4k gaming. Most gamers would choose better frame rate over bigger resolution. And it delivers of the frame rates very well! I can easily play all the games at 60 fps with ray tracing such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Psychonauts 2. And ones without ray tracing at 120 fps! That's all anybody would need. Not 4k coz most Tv's have 4K upscaling anyway lol. And the best part, the BEST PART is I get to save soooo much money by using game pass than purchasing every single game if I had bought ps5. I downloaded over 9 games worth over 30k, the cost of this console alone, for 580 bucks lololol. I already got my money's worth out of this little gem! Trust me, If you want to casually game to relax like I do, you're better off with the Xbox than PS5 only for the fact that you can save thousands of bucks by not buying every single game. I'm insanely happy with my purchase :)",5,23/06/22,xbox_seriesS,4 people found this helpful

"Edit- June 2022Still loving it!Bought - March 2021Review Date - June 2021.Context - I have 1080p 60Hz displays at my place. I don't play games like CS:GO, Valorant, etc. (you can plug in a keyboard mouse and play those too) I enjoy RPGs (GTA V, Tomb Raider, Yakuza, etc.) and sports games like FIFA.Superb Machine, it's super compact and dead silent. Fits in one corner of my desk and doesn't look loud or absurd. Like I explained to me, it's all about constant 60 fps and RPG games, some indie games too.My biggest motivation to get this console over the others was GamePass and pricing. I believe as of 2021 it is impossible to get a decent gaming set-up at 40k or even 70k for that matter due to silicon shortages and of course the pandemic. So when Next-gen dropped I knew I had to get the Series S, it perfectly suits my requirement.The biggest concern people have is storage and let me tell you it's COMPLETELY manageable. At the moment I have FIFA21, GTA V, a couple of indie games, and another 100 GB free space I can fit probably 2-3 games in that space and at a time I would mostly be playing 2-3 games. Like score, some goals on FIFA21 then jump over to GTA V do some missions, then later chill with some indie games all while listening to songs on the integrated Spotify app and just vibing bois it is great!If you are like me, a gamer who just wants to enjoy games after work or over the weekends or even play some COD with the boys this console is for you. If you really think you need the Series X then go for it.",5,14/06/21,xbox_seriesS,11 people found this helpful

"I have preordered it and it will arrive by 15th November.So for everyone’s sake let’s talk about it.PS: this will be my first console so I have no bias for ps or Xbox , I just chose what was best FOR ME.Should you buy it or not.1. The USD to rupee conversion and it costs more in India: it is there for every product that comes from the US, even the iPhone has this disparity. It is clearly because of all the tax n duty. But can you do anything about it? No. Will it change? No. Does ps5 has that issue too? Yes. So let’s stop complaining about something this n accept that this is how it is.2. Is it more powerful then the Xbox one X: yes it is n every aspect, remember that the one X is at least a 5 year old console n the processing power of series S is at par with the series X(the flagship model). The only difference is in terms of resolution and gpu power(the reason being it does not need to do 4K). The series S can display up to 1440p that is 2k at 120fps in some games like gears 5. Majority of the games run at 1080p 60fps and all the games that are make by Xbox or it’s studios will run at 1440p 60fps. Now how many of us have a 4K TV at home. So 1440p is ok for me.3. Remember that digital games are expensive: Like around Rs 4000 per games unless there is a sale. So Xbox has the game pass for that, a Netflix like the monthly subscription which give u more than 100games to play for free. So if u buy ps5 digital then you will have to buy all its exclusive games at rs 4000 as it doesn’t have such subscriptions. So if u want to buy a ps5 , I think buying a disk version is better as u can get disks for cheap.4. I am a working guy and I keep on moving either flats or different city based on my job. N this is so small that I can put it in my bag pack n take it with me like a laptop n plug it into any screen n play.5. Main problem is SSD size or storage. It’s just 364gb. Which is less my friends. So Most of the AAA games like farcry, assassins creed, watch dogs are like 60fb each. N some casual games are like 40gb each. So in a single go you can have 3 big game and 3 casual games at once. Now for me I don’t need more that that . Yes I will buy an external hard disk drive to store my games when I finish them as I don’t want to uninstall them n have the hassle to reinstall them again. I can just transfer games form the hard disk. N how many of you play more than 4games at once . I tend to focus of one game story at a time. But remember big games like Halo n cod are 100gb types so keep that in mind.So if u are ok with the storage problem and is ok with getting an external hard disk later to store games n just do that transfer to and fro whenever u wish to play which will take like 10-15mins to transfer games u r good to go.Also YouTube has make legit gamers who have reviewed this so please go check those out before deciding. As I have done my research n this Xbox series S fit in my budget and needs so I bought it. All I can say is performance won’t be an issue. Rest I suggest do some research before you invest n see if it fits your needs. Hope I helped. Cheers.",4,12/11/20,xbox_seriesS,990 people found this helpful
"The Xbox Series S is the smallest Xbox Microsoft has ever created. It’s also the Xbox with the biggest questions hanging over it. Microsoft surprised everyone with this smaller, cheaper next-gen Xbox, promising that the Series S is “designed to play games at 1440p at 60 frames per second.” At ₹35K, the Xbox Series S looks, on paper, like a budget entry into the next generation of Xbox games. But the reality is a little more complicated.  The Series S shares most of the same internal components as the larger Series X. That means you get load time improvements, games that run smoother, and the promise of up to 120fps in certain titles. The big difference is the GPU power involved, which, in reality, means most people will need to pair this tiny Xbox with a 1080p TV or monitor. This is a console for those who don’t care about 4K, but questions over its capabilities still remain for me. Will this console hold back next-gen games? Will it do ray tracing well? Will it hit 1440p?  The Xbox Series S is a small console with big potential and a whole lot of questions left unanswered for now./* PROS */-Compact Design-Performance-Quick Resume /* CONS */-Limited Storage-Mostly 1080p-Not many launch games+HARDWARE+  When we first unboxed the Xbox Series S, we was shocked at the size. It’s really tiny, and we4 adore the robotic white design. The Xbox Series S is just 275mm (10.8 inches) tall, 151mm (5.9 inches) deep, and 63.5mm (2.5 inches) wide in a vertical position. Microsoft has placed rubber feet in both vertical and horizontal positions, and there are plenty of vents for cooling. Unlike the larger Series X, we think the Xbox Series S looks great in both orientations. It can also fit comfortably into my TV stand, and it feels like it has been designed to fit a normal person’s living room, rather than taking it over like the PS5 and Xbox Series X do.  At the rear, there are two USB ports, an Ethernet port, a storage expansion slot, and HDMI 2.1 out. Microsoft has added Braille bumps next to the rear ports here, which is a great move for accessibility. At the front, there’s a single USB port and no disc drive. That’s the first big difference on the Xbox Series S besides just size: you won’t be able to use any Xbox game discs you already own. You’ll need to own digital versions of games and continue to buy games through Microsoft’s digital store.  Sadly, the Xbox Series S doesn’t support Wi-Fi 6, and there are no USB-C ports. That’s a shame for future-proofing, but we think most people will miss the disc drive here more than improvements to Wi-Fi and USB ports.  The most attention-grabbing feature of the Xbox Series S design is the speaker-like black circle at the top. It’s the main fan for the Series S, and it’s where heat exhausts out of the console. we’ve only ever heard a gentle hum from the Series S, and we’ve never heard the fans really kick in during gameplay.  In terms of heat, I’d say the Xbox Series S exhausts warmer air than the larger Series X. It’s not to the point where it’s too hot to touch, but we wouldn’t want to enclose this deep inside a TV stand where airflow is restricted.  The other piece of hardware that comes in the box with the Series S is an updated white controller. It’s very similar to the Xbox One version, with an updated D-pad, textured grips, and the addition of a new share button and a USB-C port. The share button lets you quickly share clips or screenshots with friends, much like on a PS4, while you’ll need to purchase a rechargeable play-and-charge kit separately if you want to take advantage of USB-C — the controller runs on AA batteries by default.=GAMES=  Much like the larger Xbox Series X, the Series S includes a more powerful CPU and SSD storage. Both of these hardware improvements combine with 4 teraflops of GPU performance to improve existing games. This results in dramatic improvements to load times for most games. Destiny 2, which has not yet been optimized for this console, loads in just 39 seconds on the Series S. Optimized games like Sea of Thieves load in 20 seconds, and Forza Horizon 4 takes 42 seconds to get into racing.  We’ve noticed similar improvements to existing games on the Series S that we’ve seen on the Series X. Games that are currently locked to 30fps will mostly maintain these frame rates more reliably than an Xbox One S. Destiny 2 hasn’t been optimized for the Series S yet, but it feels smoother and menus are more responsive.  We’ve also tried a variety of optimized Xbox Series S games, including Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. Both hit 60fps at 1080p on the Series S, and not the 1440p target that Microsoft promised for this console. Sea of Thieves feels like I’m playing on a PC at times, thanks to the smooth gameplay. Forza Horizon 4 also feels much smoother than what we’ve experienced on the Xbox One S version of the game running at 30fps.  Unfortunately, most games will run as if they were Xbox One S games and won’t benefit from the enhancements Microsoft made with the Xbox One X. That’s mostly because the Series S isn’t targeting 4K, and most of the One X enhancements were geared toward 4K resolution and HDR.That means, a lot of the time, the Xbox Series S still feels like an Xbox One S. Titles that use dynamic resolution scaling will also benefit from hitting the max resolution target more often, but without testing the thousands of games available, it’s hard to pick out big changes here. The changes we noticed the most came from the optimized games we’ve been testing, and they provide a glimpse at what’s possible on the Xbox Series S.  Gears 5 and Dirt 5 also demonstrate the ability for the Series S to deliver smooth 120fps gaming. The versus multiplayer mode of Gears 5 runs at 120fps on the Series S, and it feels far smoother than what’s available on the Xbox One S right now. Dirt 5 also runs in a 120fps mode, reducing the input latency when you’re cornering with the various cars in the game.  These optimized games and 120Hz modes really demonstrate the potential for the Xbox Series S, but if you’re planning to pair the Series S with a 1440p or 1080p high refresh monitor, we would check to make sure it supports 120Hz over the HDMI port. My own 1440p monitor runs at 165Hz via DisplayPort, but over HDMI, it’s limited to just 60Hz. Most modern monitors should include HDMI 2.0, but a lot of high refresh rate gaming monitors have shipped in recent years without HDMI 2.0 support.  While the Xbox Series S isn’t designed to be a 4K console, we’ve spent a lot of time using it on a 4K TV. Some titles like Destiny 2 don’t look that great automatically upscaled to a 4K TV, but others, like Watch Dogs: Legion, looked good to me. we imagine my OLED display helps mask a lot of the resolution imperfections in Watch Dogs: Legion though, as the game is set in London where it’s regularly dark and raining.  we should note here that while we was testing Watch Dogs: Legion on the Xbox Series S, Microsoft disabled the game midway through the review period. Before that, Watch Dogs: Legion had managed to totally lock up my console, turning it off entirely once. It also crashed frequently while we was playing it. we reported these issues, and it turns out, this version of Watch Dogs: Legion will include an optimized patch for Series S at launch. The version we had been testing “is not representative of the experience players will have on Xbox Series X|S,” Microsoft says.  we wasn’t able to replicate any similar crashes or issues with other games we tested on the Xbox Series S, so it looks like this was limited to this build of Watch Dogs: Legion. Given the game has been crashing Xbox One X consoles and PCs, it clearly has larger stability issues.  Just like the Series X, there’s a trend emerging for next-gen Xbox games that offer much more choice and flexibility. Dirt 5, Gears 5, and Yakuza: Like a Dragon all offer a choice between higher frame rates or visual quality. I’m hoping this trend continues across both the Series X and Series S.  One trend with the Xbox Series S we’ve also spotted is that most optimized games appear to be targeting 1080p at 60fps instead of 1440p at 60fps. Microsoft made a big deal about this being a 1440p console, but Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4, Fortnite, Watch Dogs: Legion, and For Honor will all run at 1080p instead. Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Gears Tactics are exceptions to what looks like the normal, but Yakuza only hits 1440p at 30fps.  I’d like to imagine developers are simply targeting 1080p, as that’s what most people will be using the Xbox Series S for, and it’s a relatively easy lift. I’m surprised that Microsoft’s own first-party games like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4 aren’t hitting 1440p, though. I’m hoping I’ll be proved wrong, and we’ll see lots of 1440p games for the Xbox Series S in the coming months, but we have a feeling this is very much going to be a 1080p console.=STORAGE & SOFTWARE=  Two of the biggest benefits of the Xbox Series S over the existing Xbox One are storage and a new Quick Resume feature. SSD storage boosts load times and performance, and I’m really glad Microsoft picked this for the cheaper Series S. While it’s great to have the fast speeds, we don’t think there’s enough storage space on the Series S for most people.  You only get 364GB of usable storage on the Series S. We have six games installed on the Series S, and it’s almost full. Call of Duty: Warzone and Destiny 2 take up over 100GB each, leaving little space for more games. Even if we estimate that the average AAA game is around 50GB, that’s still only seven games in total.  Microsoft has promised that Xbox Series S game install sizes will be around 30 percent smaller than the Series X, but we’ve noticed Gears 5 is 76.4GB on both the Series S and Series X. We hope games do get a lot smaller, but for now, the storage will be a problem for many. You can offload games to USB storage and then switch them back to the internal storage when you want to play them, but most would benefit from the expandable storage here.  The only option to expand the Xbox Series S storage is a 1TB expansion card priced at around ₹17K. That’s nearly three-quarters of the price of the console itself; combined, it’s nearly ₹52K for the Series S and additional storage. That’s more than the ₹50K price of the Xbox Series X, which comes with twice as much built-in storage. Microsoft needs to either release an Xbox Series S with 1TB of storage or introduce more sizes of expandable storage for this console. Either of these options, including buying USB storage, will cost you more money, though.  If you do manage to fill up the Xbox Series S with plenty of games, you’ll be able to quickly switch between them, thanks to Quick Resume. It suspends games and saves them to disk after you switch to another title, meaning you can switch back and, 10 seconds later, your game is ready to play.  We think this is the best new feature across the Xbox Series S and X, and when it works, it works really well. Unfortunately, not all games support it. GTA V, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4, and many others don’t support Quick Resume. Microsoft is still working to enable Quick Resume on a number of games due to a “recently discovered platform bug,” so updates should arrive after launch. While most games should support Quick Resume, it’s still not clear which missing ones will get updated.  We also ran into an issue with Quick Resume on Gears 5 during my final day of testing where it failed to load the game and presented a “something went wrong” error. After launching the game again, twice, it finally loaded properly without my Quick Resume point. We ran into issues like these frequently with the Xbox Series X preview unit, but this is the only time we’ve experienced the software problem on a retail unit.  Speaking of software, the Series S also includes the same dashboard as the Series X. If you’re an Xbox One user, it looks identical, as Microsoft has kept the same interface and features here. It definitely feels like it performs faster, and we think the general improvements that have been made to the Xbox dashboard in recent months have helped here.  We still find the Xbox guide cumbersome to use sometimes, though. Microsoft could do with offering more customization options here and simplifying the interface further. I’d also like to see the sharing of clips greatly improved. The Xbox Series S has a new share button, but it still takes far too long for clips and screenshots to be uploaded to Microsoft’s Xbox Live service for you to share them.  This is a problem that exists on the Xbox One, and we’ve had to wait minutes for clips to be available, despite having a fast 1Gbps upload at home. On my gaming PC, we can instantly stream clips or my screen to friends on Discord, and the Xbox process feels old and slow in comparison. =POTENTIAL=  I’m a big fan of this Xbox Series S design, and the console delivers a great value for ₹35K. If you own an original Xbox One, you’ll immediately see the benefits of load times, faster frame rates, and generally smoother gameplay in most games.  Much like the Xbox Series X, it feels like upgrading a PC if you move from an Xbox One. All accessories work, as do games, and many will run even better than before. This will be a significant upgrade for many games, but don’t expect to buy the Series S for the latest and greatest graphics.  This is absolutely a 1080p console, right now. I’m puzzled why Microsoft said the Series S is “designed to play games at 1440p at 60 frames per second.” That might be true in the future, but right now, some of its own studios have chosen to optimize and target 1080p, and lots of third-party developers are doing the same for Series S games.  A 1440p target would deliver crisper imagery at 1080p and even far better upscaling to 4K if you really wanted to push the Series S. There’s clearly potential for the Series S to deliver 1440p, as Gears Tactics shows. But given the vast majority of Series S owners won’t even use a 1440p display, we can sort of understand the 1080p choices being made. I’m just hoping games for the Series S move more toward 1440p, and not the sub 1080p direction.#VERDICT#  It feels like the Series S has a lot of potential but not enough games to fully realize what this smaller Xbox can do. I’m hoping to see more games offer 120fps modes on the Series S, choices for graphical settings, and ray tracing. There’s a lot of promise here, but it feels too early to say exactly how the Series S will perform in this next generation.  The storage situation will also make this a difficult purchase for some and steer others toward the Series X or even the ₹40K digital PS5. But the Series S feels like the ideal console for Xbox Game Pass, until xCloud is really a thing people can use reliably on their TVs.  The Xbox Series S is full of unknowns right now. The use case for this console isn’t as obvious as some might think. It’s not necessarily the best budget option, thanks to the storage situation. Yet, it looks ideal for a bedroom TV, for Xbox Game Pass, or as a Fortnite console. If you can deal with the storage and you’re only playing on a 1080p TV, then this should make Xbox games shine like never before. I’m just not sure what else it will deliver for the next generation of games we’re all excited about.",4,23/11/20,xbox_seriesS,111 people found this helpful
"Disclaimer: It's just my personal opinion and the problems that I have faced, so it's not a ganeralized review, don't get triggered.Note: The only reason I bought this because PS5 is almost impossible to get in MSRP, and I just wanted to have a console and play a few specific titles.1. Game Pass: I appreciate this one, got mine for 600 rupees for 8 months for the first time and then 600 per month. You'll get over 100 games you know the whole story. Most of the games are just meh, but there are some AAA games too I found more than 15 games that I wanna play so a good deal for me, and you get a bit of discount on games as well if you want to purchase some titles specifically.2. Pricing: Simply outrageous. 300 USD is between 21000-22000 INR (Around the time I'm writing this review) and this is 35000. Even after those so called 'customs and taxes' that government eats, price is still very high. Same thing with other electronics as well.3. Performance: Been using it for over 2 weeks, no problem so far. Not going into technical analysis as there are a ton of videos about that on YouTube. Games that are only marked as 'optimized for series s' can go over 60 fps and beyond. Not all Xbox 360 games will run at 60fps. You won't have any problem with the gameplay at all.4. Backward Compatibility: Well, kinda. But mostly disappointed, one of the reason why I bought this machine is because this is backward compatible with all previous gens of Xbox, which is somewhat true, but a whole lot of games from previous gen will not be available. For example, I want to purchase Prince of Persia trilogy and other titles of the series but only Forgotten sands is available for purchase, Sands of time is listed in the store but it says 'Not available separately' others aren't even there and you won't find most of the previous gen games in the store at all, as it's a digital only console, you can't play them with the disc either.5. In-store purchases: There are some problems with that, although this point is very subjective and other people may not bother paying 50-60 rupees extra or a little more than that, as there is a wallet system in PlayStation, I can purchase a wallet top up from Amazon, say a 2000 rupees top up for exactly 2000 rupees, delivery in an hour or two, and use it to pay for the online in-store purchases. But there's no such reliable system here in Indian Xbox account, I only have to use my card to pay and the problem is, they'll charge me for the currency conversion, I end up paying a bit extra than the actual price of the game. Which is very much avoidable if they do something with a proper wallet system. Wallet top ups are not available in India, at least not for fair price, I saw websites charging 1500 rupees for a 999 top up and that's ridiculous.6. Emulation: I think this is a worth mentioning point as this console can emulate games of every other console if you don't already know, including PS1, PS2, PS3, Wii, Wii u, Gameboy and previous gen consoles from nintendo. There are videos on YouTube that you can refer if you're into this.7. Exclusive titles: That's the only problem that turns off a whole lot of people, there are really not that impressive titles as compared to the PlayStation or PC then again, personal taste. I really want to play Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon series, Last of Us series, Uncharted series, God of War and others, not to mention some really cool upcoming exclusive titles on PlayStation. But there are a few titles like RYSE son of rome, fable 2, red dead redemption (First part) that are xbox exclusives, rest is really upto your personal preferences.These are just a few things I've experienced so far, overall, I'm happy with my purchase and of course will buy a PlayStation as well in future but not leaving Xbox. I'll keep both of them.All the mentioned things are just my personal experience and some points are highly subjective, so may not be applicable or helpful for everyone, it wasn't a full fledged review, just some points for people to keep in mind before purchasing the console, if you're only concerned about the performance, you won't have any issue, it is surprisingly good, but just not for 35000 rupees, provided that the PS5 digital edition is just 5000 rupees away.",3,29/12/21,xbox_seriesS,44 people found this helpful
"If you're someone who does not have the budget for the series X but wants to play all the latest and upcoming games as soon as they come out, Series S will not disappoint you. The hardware on both the series X and the series S are same, the only difference is the GPU which is 4 tera flops on series S and 12 tera flops on series X. But you won't notice much difference if you don't plan to play on 4K etc.Console is extremely quiet, which I love about it. You won't hear anything running in the console unless you literally put your cheek on the vent. For the price point, series S is an amazing machine that's very powerful and compactNOTE: It's highly likely that the power plug you'll get is european and the console most probably be imported. Not to worry, you can still claim warranty for it by contacting Microsoft. Just make sure you have the full 1 year warranty for the console when you register it on the website's your devices section. In case you don't(I didn't) get the full 365 days warranty, you can contact Microsoft chat support for the same and they'll do it for you the same day.

Received Genuine Microsoft Xbox but Amazon packing must be improved,4,22/11/24,xbox_seriesS,
"Delivered on time and in perfect condition.I got this primarily because building a PC that can match the capability of this little machine is impossible at the price point.Also this is my first console.Given the fanboying around the PS5 digital being closely priced to this, it wasn't available anywhere nor is it going to be anytime soon.That being said the Series S is kind of a underpowered machine which is irrelevant for me as i do not have any 4k displays/tv. There are no frame drops even in the harsh climate we have here in Mumbai at 1080p and the device can get hot.So for the people confused as to which they should go for the PS5 or the Xbox, i believe the only edge the PS has right now is the exclusive games if those are specifically the ones that you want to play. Otherwise if you don't have a 4k output, this is a no brainer.Nevertheless the list of pros and cons below.Pros:1. Easy on the pocket but still plays all latest titles. I am playing forza horizon 5, Red dead 2 (still not optimized for series s or x and plays on 30 fps) and they run without issues.2. Game pass, there is no real competitor to this service.3. Compact and silent though the corners are pointed.Cons:1. Storage: Free space is around 360 GB which is less considering the two games i have menitoned above take up 100GB each. But it is up to the user to finish games before downloading new ones rather than wanting to play 5 high end games at one time.All arguments considered storage is bit of a bummer.2. No discs: For the first time console owner this isn't a problem at all but it is a serious one for some one who own previous generations.3. Controller: the controller is good but runs pn batteries, so an arrangement may be required to get in rechargeable batteries depending on how much time you spend playing.Overall a fun and compact console which i can recommend along with the game pass. Just take care to place in a well ventilated area and ypu are good.",4,04/06/22,xbox_seriesS,6 people found this helpful
"The gameplay experience is very smooth, and moreover if you have a 4K TV, it upscales the graphics. Overall a very pleasant experience 🙂 and a lot of games to choose upon. I feel Xbox Series S is a standard and compact console that just makes gaming better. Thanks to the seller, the console was in a perfect condition.",5,03/10/24,xbox_seriesS,
"I bought this item recently for my son, actually for myself in the name of my son to be honest. I am not a gamer or a pro, however I think the if you are looking for something to shoot things with, then a controller might not be your thing. Your Aim sucks on controller, I don’t know how people actually play with these controllers. For non shooter games, its a best value for your money.",4,07/05/24,xbox_seriesS,One person found this helpful
"Its been a month since i've been using Xbox series S. Not gonna list pros and cons of it. Im just gonna give my opinion on why i think its worth every penny.1. Cheapest next gen experience without any compromise. PS: i dont consider 4k 120fps a compromise coz i dont need those to enjoy a game.2. Design: its compact and simple yet very elegant. Can be fit anywhere. Pretty dense as well.3. Connectivity: Connects with anything seemlessly. Although, i'd recommend ethernet for initial setup.4. Game Pass: Game pass has literally 100s of all kinda games to enjoy. Initially it costs 59rs for 3 months and 700 after that which i think is decent considering how expensive games actually are.5. Performance: Initially, i was using it on full hd tv and after 20 days of usage i moved to 4K tv. And on both tvs, it works like it can take anything in its stride. Not even high graphic games like cyberpunk or Gears 5 or Far Cry 5.6. Cost of Ownership: The final cost of ownership is very less than any next gen consoles out there which is big plus obviously.7. Game Offers: I have seen frequent offers on games on the xbox store. I bought GTA 5 with mods for 800rs only and metro exodus series for only 500 etc.8. Recommendations: if you plan to buy it and get game pass, please do try the XS optimized games for next gen feel.9. Vision of Microsoft: Microsoft and Sony have very different vision for gaming in future. And Microsoft wants everyone to be involved in the gaming ecosystem and make it affordable and cloud enabled. I support the vision.Conclusion: if you are a casual gamer who plays it after working hours or on weekends, this should be atleast be in your consideration.",5,13/02/21,xbox_seriesS,6 people found this helpful
"The Xbox Series S is a compact next gen console. Here is few things to consider before you buy. Have you moved to disc free gaming? Do you have a 4K TV? Or do you like to play games at a solid 1080p / 1440p 60 fps? Personally I'll choose the later. The Series S does exactly that. The storage might be a downside but coming from an OG Xbox one, this definitely an upgrade. Now it's up to the developers to make games that are optimized for the series S and am sure that will present a few challenges down the line.Played Cyberpunk 2077 about an hour or so and it runs at a constant 1080p 30 FPS ( I have a 1080p 60Hz Monitor) The game is not optimized yet for Series X or S but when it will, it'll be gorgeous. The load times and the quick resume are great features to have. The custom RDNA2 architecture more than makes up for the Jaguar core of the Xbox One systems.The console is evenly priced allthough a price of 30k would have been ideal. But hey you cant get ray tracing in a 30 k PC build. So that more than makes up for itself. So would you regret buying one? Well depends on your playstyle. For me moving from an OG Xbox One to this is surely an upgrade.",4,16/01/21,xbox_seriesS,2 people found this helpful
"This is a great product of you are new to console gaming and want to explore multiple games at low cost and don't care about 4K resolution that much. Don't go by the size, this console is next to the beast when it comes to performance. You get all the new gen features like high speed storage, ultra fast loading speeds, quick resume and high FPS. The heat management on this device is done very well and on par with the series X and PS5, It is impossible to hear any sound from the console even if you are playing multiple games. The loading time for games is similar to series X and PS5, and with quick resume feature you will hardly have to wait for games to load anymore.Microsoft is pushing hard for the all access to the gaming world with their game pass services, you get to explore multiple games at a monthly rate and don't have to worry about shelling out thousands on games.The most optimal way of enjoying this console is on a 1440p Monitor with 120Hz + refresh rate and HDR support. If you don't have a 4K TV then it will be very foolish to spend money on buying PS5 or series X.Most games can't achieve 1440p resolution even though microsoft says this console targets 1440p, you will be able to play most of the games at 1080p only at the moment. This might change in the future with more developer support for the console. Microsoft is incentivising the game developers to optimise their games for Series S.If you are okay with compromising on resolution then this is a no brainer buy for anyone who wants to get a next gen console without spending 50k.",5,14/05/21,xbox_seriesS,2 people found this helpful
"This Console, though with 512GB SSD Storage out of which, 364GB Approx is Available Storage, is quite a Functional and cost Effective Console, for the Casual Gamer. Hardcore Gamers may of-course look towards the Big Brothers like PS5, and XBox Series X, but their Availability in the present Market  scenario is a Pain.Being a Casual Gamer, mostly into Racing or some Simulations, this is the Device I chose over the Big Brothers, and I Don't regret. This is an All Digital Console, One can download Games from Xbox App Directly to the Console, and with Xbox Game Pass Subscription coming at Very Nominal Prices, its even more easier to lay hands over 100s of games, First Day Launches and More!Moreover, Not Many Games are required to be installed or played at a time for a casual gamer. 1-2 games of choice are sufficient at a time, i believe.I have presently Installed Forza Horizon 5 (110GB), Halo Infinite (68GB) , Microsoft Train Sim World 2 (26GB) and Microsoft Flight Simulator Standard (This is huge and size is approx 120GB). All these installed and I still have approx 64GB left and Performance of the Console is Fast and Smooth.Loading Time for any of above games is Hardly about a Minute.Overall, a Budget friendly Gaming Console, with Next Gen Gaming Features as well as support for previous generation Games!!",5,16/02/22,xbox_seriesS,2 people found this helpful
"I have a PS4, due to PS5 shortage at the time I bought XBOX Series S. Perfect console for me, I don't get time to play much now a days due to work and I play mostly only on weekends. With XBOX Gamepass this is just the best. It can play older XBOX 360 games like RDR1, GTA 4, All the old CODs, TimeSplitters, Fable 1, 2, 3, etc but you do have to buy them from the XBOX store (no disc) and most of them are on the XBOX pass also. And plays modern games on 1080p very smoothly. No more loosing mind over tweaking the setting to get the optimal graphic and FPS like with the PC.",5,07/08/23,xbox_seriesS,12 people found this helpful
"What I love:1. Game loading speed: The SSD makes everything super fast, even the switching time from one game to another - ""instant resume feature"" !2. Form factor: I'm amazed by its overall size, compact, easy to take anywhere you go in a backpack, especially while traveling and the minimalistic black and white look is a bonus. This is a silent machine as well !3. Game Pass: Day one itself, you already have 100+ games if you subscribe at ₹489 (console) or ₹699 (console + Gold membership + all EA Play games). No more buying physical game DVDs which are hell slow.4. Integration: The Xbox app is a gem ! You can play on a phone or a tab, wireless, where all the game processing happens on console. Phone can be used as a controller as well. I also have been completely into the Microsoft ecosystem and the apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, YouTube, OneDrive, Media Player, Apple TV etc are great add onsWhat I Don't Love:1. Actually, nothing !Have been playing for a month now and honestly haven't faced any issues till now.Only downside is the storage capacity, with only 512 GB, you can have max 6-10 games installed, but you always can uninstall and re install games quickly based on what you are currently playing. So that helps !This console is a bit costly in India, but this is a next gen console for next 4-5 years and works with all upcoming games as well ! So going for a cheaper PlayStation 4 Pro or slim keeps you restricted to older game only ! PlayStation would be a bad choice now.",5,26/04/21,xbox_seriesS,5 people found this helpful
All consoles are good in there own way. Whatever your mind say just go for it. I pick this console because of the price range which I guess matter alot for most of people.Read before you buy.1. You are not going to get any Pc built for the high end games which you can play on xbox series s.2. All console need a game pass which cost you around 650 - 800 per month. But I got 7 month extra as offer was applied. So make sure if you can pay for pass only thenyou buy any console.3. I'm not a pro gamer so space issue is not very much deal to me. But Yes if you want to install more and more game. You definitely switch to upper Series X or PS5. Or may be you can buy the Expensive SSD.4. Many people will say go for PS5 just for games you can get on it. But Bros no one going to give you free games. You all have to spend money to buy game and I don't know which games are not available for Xbox series. I almost found every game on game pass or in the microsoft store.Verdict : Depend on your money and availability you can go for any console you just love to play game it's depends on your budget now.,5,17/01/22,xbox_seriesS,7 people found this helpful
"There are several video reviews that enumerate the pros and cons of the Xbox Series S, so I won't go into too much detail here.There is no reason that most gamers shouldn't have the Series S as their primary console, especially in India. It's very cheap and when you throw in the Xbox Game pass, the value proposition here is ludicrous.The only two drawbacks are lack of 4K gaming and no disc support. The former is a ""first world problem"", because those that can afford 4K gaming can also usually afford scalper rates for the Series X or PS5. The latter is just stalling for time, as all digital gaming is an inevitability. Sad, but true.But the Series S is available now at market value. Snag it as soon as you can(put it on EMI like I did if you have to) and rest assured that you'll have a decent gaming setup for the next few years at least.If you must upgrade to a PS5 (for exclusives) or the Xbox Series X (for ""hardcore gaming""), do it in a couple of years when the supply hopefully exceeds demand. Till then, this little beast will not disappoint!Note: I'm a Sony Pony and this is my first forray into the Xbox ecosystem. I never would have taken the plunge if it weren't for the affordability of the Series S. Take that for what it's worth.",5,17/12/21,xbox_seriesS,3 people found this helpful
"Review after using for 15 months.Bought the series s at the time, as the series x/ps5 were not available in India, but I was worried the performance may not be up to par. After playing many AAA games courtesy of game pass, I can confirm that this is not the case. Have never faced frame drops or freezes in any games. The portability was also surprisingly good. I was able to carry the console along with cables and 2 controllers easily in a laptop backpack, and it's very light too.However, during side by side comparisons it's evident that the series x has better graphics, so if you're coming from a high end pc, the graphical performance may not be satisfactory. Another com is that with only about 360 gigs of useable storage, you can only keep very few games at a time.Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone who does not require the absolute cutting edge in graphics, and for people who require that, a pc would probably be a better option than a series X anyway.",5,09/08/22,xbox_seriesS,7 people found this helpful
"If you want to play games with good graphics then this is not for you, this is just to play games at playable framerate with low graphics quality.Plus it's better to buy gamepass than buying games for series S since you will be playing at low graphics quality i wouldn't recommend to buy a game for 3000 or 4000rs rather you buy gamepass and play games that comes in it, those are great and the list is dynamic they add new games every month ,it's like Netflix but for games",4,25/03/23,xbox_seriesS,4 people found this helpful
"What I love most about it is how compact it is. It just tucks away into my tv's side cabinet and looks like a showpiece item, a befitting aesthetic as the games look gorgeous.I have played Control UE and Forza Horizon 4 thus far and they look gorgeous in spite of them being 2 year old games. I have a 4k tv and while these games look great, I have noticed that a few last gen titles look bad as they run an upscaled One S version. eg. Control runs at 720p 30fps, and it looked bad enough that I bought the 1080p 60fps Ultimate Edition. I don't suppose this would be a problem going forward as games are optimized. The Control UE was gorgeous and had butter smooth gameplay.The console is also extraordinarily quiet and thereby ensures that you get really good audio.A recommendation is getting rechargeable batteries. The controllers require a lot of juice for vibration effects.",4,10/11/21,xbox_seriesS,
"So here is the deal. Graphical wise almost all features such as ambient occulsion, ray tracing, vilumetric lighting.. its all there the only thing is the console outputs to 1080p max while in 60fps, which in my opinion is not very noticeable as once you get “into the zone” you will barely notice it.No performance issues or bugs or crashes in the entire period of 2 months, quick resume works like a charm and is a game changer, seriously forget about the graphics, quick resume will save you so so so much time in life that you’ll be able to play tons of games.STORAGE: so if you say 364gb is less in 2021 yes you are correct its less, but games on series s do not use 4k textures thus most of the game’s size is a bit less than their series x/ ps5 versions. Also in my experience I found storage to be sufficient as any normal gamer would only play 2-3 AAA titles at once (dont tell me you’re gonna play Gears, Halo5 and destiny all together everyday) you can easily keep like 2 AAA games and around 5-6 more indie games or previous GEN games.See in my opinion this is one of the best deals if you wanna experience Next Gen at low price, although i will say one thing, the graphical output is not as good as a PS5 but you’ll notice that only when youre running both consoles side by side on 2 TVs or else its mot much of a difference.(Also getting the game pass will literally save you thousands of dollars and you wont need to purvhase another game for next 6 months)",5,14/02/21,xbox_seriesS,One person found this helpful

It's been a long time dream of owning a console. And Microsoft is just doing that - ""Power Your Dreams"" as the box says.I didn't have high expectations, because at 30K you can't own an above par gaming PC. So I thought a console would perform more or less the same. But damn, as I started playing on this tiny beast, I understood its potential. Yes, it may not be future proof, but consoles are not meant to last decades together. You can easily play all if not most of the games released until now and maybe couple more years, until Series S can't keep up with the graphic requirements of next gen games.To sum up, if you're a casual or a hardcore gamer who doesn't own a gaming pc or a beginner who want to get into the world of gaming, Series S is your best bet. If you have some extra dough, have a 4K monitor/TV and you're lucky if it's in stock, go for Series X which is more future proof.Gamertag - suhasasj010",5,24/06/22,xbox_seriesS,9 people found this helpful

"Being still early in my career and I felt it wasn’t wise to spend a month’s paycheque on a gaming console.  But then i saw many reviews about Series S, and that gave me some faith to give Series S a shot. And I’m so glad that I did. Yes, it doesnt output 4K, but from a decent distance you can hardly tell any difference, unless youre pixel peeping. The graphics still look amazing, and most newer games Ives played, play at almost constant 60fps. Plus Xbox Game Pass is a blessing, the collection there is great. AAA Titles like AC Odyssey are readily available to play. I play on Samsung QLED TV, and everyday I’m surprised how well this 30k inr console performs.",5,20/02/23,xbox_seriesS,4 people found this helpful
"I've been using this console for like almost 2 months. Worth every penny. First off all iam not a hardcore gamer who play like 24*7, just a casual gamer so this series s is more than enough for me. The X and S are almost the same, if u r not into 4k go for it. u couldn't notice the difference between HD and 4k unless you're nitpicking. The combact factor and it's overall design attracted me. The storage is not a problem for me coz i don't play like many games at a time.In brief, the SS is just awesome.

"The Apple AirTag is a useful and straightforward solution for keeping track of my belongings. Setting it up was quick and simple—just a tap to connect with my iPhone, and I was good to go. Its sleek and compact design makes it easy to attach to items like keys, bags, or even my wallet.The location tracking is precise, and the Find My app provides a clear view of the item’s location. When I need to locate something nearby, the Precision Finding feature is especially helpful. It uses haptic feedback and on-screen directions to guide me to the exact spot. The sound the AirTag emits is also loud enough to hear from a distance, which makes it easier to find items when they’re buried or hidden.The battery life is impressive, and the AirTag uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery, so there’s no need to replace the whole device when the battery runs low. It’s also water and dust-resistant, which adds to its durability for everyday use.While the AirTag works well for finding nearby items, if it’s far out of Bluetooth range, it depends on the broader Apple network to help locate it, which works most of the time but isn’t quite as immediate as I’d prefer in some situations.Satisfaction with Packaging: The packaging was secure, and the setup was straightforward without any issues.Likelihood of Recommending: I would recommend the AirTag to anyone who wants an easy, reliable way to track their belongings.Price Reasonableness: The price is on the higher side for a small tracker, but the quality and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it a worthwhile investment.",4,30/11/24,apple_air_tag,34 people found this helpful

Since they had iPhones we were able to get police involved and go to the final destination and our dog was there and we were able to get dog, collar and air tag returned. We at least now know that if someone finds him with an iPhone it will show location of the air tag.",4,13/02/25,apple_air_tag,
"I recently purchased the AirTag, and I must say, it has been incredibly useful! As someone who tends to misplace things often, this little device has saved me so much time and stress. Setting it up was a breeze—just attach it to your items, and you're good to go.The precision of the location tracking is impressive, and I love how it integrates seamlessly with my iPhone. I can easily check the location of my keys, bag, or even my pet on the Find My app. The sound feature is helpful too—it’s easy to hear when you’re in a pinch and need to locate something quickly.What I love most is the peace of mind it provides. Whether you're traveling or just moving around at home, you can rest assured knowing that your things are within reach. Definitely worth the investment for anyone looking to stay organized and reduce those “Where did I leave it?” moments.Highly recommend!",5,23/01/25,apple_air_tag,6 people found this helpful
"Airtags are great.  They came in very handy for giving me peace of mind during some long-distance travel.  I had my car shipped for part of the trip and I could watch on an iPhone map where in the country my car was at any minute.  Also, if you have one in your wallet or purse or key ring and you can’t find those in your house, just click on the phone app and it will show you how to walk to the right place within a certain distance (30’ I think) to find your missing keys, etc.  I’d rate it a “5” except in the four-pack of Air Tags I bought only 3 worked even after replacing the battery.",4,14/02/25,apple_air_tag,

They were able to call me from it and I was able to tell them my address and go tmy bags back.

I originally purchased AirTags to place in all of my family’s luggage. Airlines are always misplacing luggage and using an AirTag helps with locating them. I recently purchased a dog collar that has a place for an AirTag. My puppy has gotten loose and we added an airTag to the collar. You will be alerted when the battery needs to be changed (after about a year). Easy to purchase batteries on Amazon. Easy to install.  Everyone needs airtags.,5,24/01/25,apple_air_tag,

Once it's setup, you can easily see it's location from the app on the phone.  Lost your keys?  Not an issue, the on-phone app will direct you to where they are, as long as it can connect to them.The only issue I've had is when the battery dies, I highly recommend watching a video or two to understand how best to replace the battery.

"I had never used AirTags before, nor completely understood the application of AirTags to prevent theft, find your devices, or get an alert to your phone when leaving an item behind - such as your tagged wallet or keys.I tagged my keys and my wallet.  If I walk out the door without either item, I get an alert to my phone indicating I've left the item behind.  The AirTag can then by tracked by my phone and will direct me to the precise location of the item, such as my keys or wallet.Before AirTags? I used to search for items that fell behind the couch or that I dropped getting out of the car or credit cards (tagged wallet) that I left in the restaurant.  If my wallet were stolen, I would get a ""separation"" alert showing the location of the stolen wallet.  Of course, I would then immediately disable my credit cards.These provide a great piece of mind in my daily hectic life.  After I bought the first one, and learned how they worked, I bought two more (with cases) for my luggage.  You can also put a tag on your dog's collar or in your child's backpack.  The uses are endless.The price dropped from 29 dollars, or so, to 19.00 and you can get a similar discount for a 4 pack.  You won't regret it!",5,17/11/24,apple_air_tag,One person found this helpful

Henry won't stay in, he gets rather disagreeable if not allowed out, frankly that's how he came to live at my brother's home. The neighborhood is cat and dog friendly but Henry has a habit of jumping inside cars, he's done at least one ride laying on the neighbor's backseat. Even though Sir Smugness is chipped we kind of wanted something a little more, hence the collar and air tag. I've got to admit it's fun to see where he goes, that he's safe, and not heading to the Jersey Shore.Part of the fun is the cat icon is a ginger cat not surprisingly Sir Henry of Smugness is also a ginger. My brother said it was easy to set up.The collar is good quality and Henry hasn't itched at it, which he tended to do with his other collars. The air tag fits snuggly in the holder.

"1. Performance:The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.2. Battery Life:One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.3. Fanless Design:The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.4. Portability:The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.5. Compatibility:The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.6. Rosetta 2:Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.7. Price:The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.8. Integrated Graphics:The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.9. Limited Port Selection:The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.10. Upgradability:The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase.",5,19/10/23,mac,187 people found this helpful

"*This is my secondary device*As a writer churning out 3,000-4,000 words daily, the MacBook Air M1 serves as a reliable secondary device. While it's not my primary workstation, it effortlessly handles my writing needs. The keyboard, with its tactile and responsive keys, is a delight to type on. However, transitioning from a Windows machine, I did encounter a learning curve with the unique macOS shortcuts.For light tasks like browsing, emailing, and word processing, the M1's snappy performance is impressive. However, when pushing it with multiple heavy-duty applications, the 8GB RAM can sometimes become a bottleneck. If you're seeking a long-term investment, the M2 variant with more RAM would be a wiser choice.Nevertheless, considering its price point of around 53k in 2024, the MacBook Air M1 offers exceptional value for money. It's a solid choice for writers, students, and casual users who need a reliable and portable device.",4,08/12/24,mac,13 people found this helpful

You set reminders to call 20 people in a day on MacBook Air & it is on your apple mobile & on your Apple Watch. Just go for it & you will forget any windows laptops. Don’t think that MacBook Air M1 or any product of Apple is show off but it is amazing in any aspects.

It was a good incident as the serial number of the MacBook pertaining to that order was already in use. The warranty of that product started 5 days before the order was placed for the same. Hence it’s a caution ⚠️ —- Do check your warranty using the serial no of the product before you accept the product. It might happen that everything is packed and sealed but the product which you’re receiving is already a returned product or a used one. Beware of this. Just make sure you check the warranty using the serial number that it’s not yet started while you’re receiving it and you are good to go. This time my product is genuine hence sharing the video. This is my second macbook. My first MacBook Pro m1 13 inch had an auto shutdown issue after 3 years of usage fixing which was costlier than getting this hence I ordered this. I hope it goes well. Hopefully this will last long . 🤞,4,15/10/24,mac,66 people found this helpful

"I recently purchased the mac, and overall, it has been an excellent addition to my tech arsenal. The performance is stellar, handling multitasking and demanding applications with ease. The design is sleek and modern, making it a joy to use both at home and on the go.However, there’s one notable issue: I occasionally experience a mild shock when charging. While this has not been a dealbreaker for me, it is concerning and something potential buyers should be aware of. I recommend using a grounded outlet or checking the charging equipment to mitigate this problem.In summary, the mac delivers impressive performance and design, but the charging issue is something to consider.

"Kellogg's Muesli Fruit, Nut & Seeds has become my absolute favorite breakfast choice! This 750g pack is packed with a perfect blend of multigrains, dried fruits, nuts, and seeds, making it a powerhouse of nutrition. Each bite is a delightful mix of crunchy and chewy textures, with just the right amount of sweetness from the fruits.What I love most is how filling and satisfying it is. It keeps me energized throughout the morning without feeling heavy. The mix of oats, wheat, corn, and barley, combined with almonds, raisins, and seeds, offers a balanced meal that’s rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile – I enjoy it with milk, yogurt, or even as a topping for smoothies.Knowing that it’s India’s No. 1 Muesli gives me confidence in its quality. Kellogg's has truly nailed it with this 12-in-1 power breakfast. It’s not just a cereal, but a wholesome start to the day. Highly recommended for anyone looking to kickstart their mornings with something delicious and nutritious! And I have recommended this to my family, friends and relatives they started using it and they are very satisfied with this. They are loving each and every bit of it and they are buying it regularly!!",5,14/08/24,Kellogg's_Muesli,9 people found this helpful

"It's a good product from JBL who are world leaders in audios. The output is ideal for a mid sized room, the lows are picked up well by the woofer, which is more of a Punchy sound rather than a Boomy one.  Easy to set up.  In my opinion,.I wonder, is the output really 590 watts as claimed?  I personally felt the Woofer, rated by JBL at 300 watts should have been more powerful.  But this may be a personal choice.  I hope JBL answers this.But go ahead with your eyes closed, this sound bar is worth its price for sure.Aseem Varma",5,11/10/24,JBL_Bar_500_Pro_Dolby_Atmos,8 people found this helpful

I really feel pity on those who rated this product 4 and above. Actually it's a piece of scrap from JBL which produces very low class bass. I must say it's output is around 100 watts whereas company claims it around 590 watts. Final verdict - Don't waste your money otherwise you will definitely regret. Anyway the choice is always yours! It doesn't deserve to be of even 5k product.,1,25/12/24,JBL_Bar_500_Pro_Dolby_Atmos,2 people found this helpful

"Better than Bose and other sound bars which cost 1.2 or 1.5 times of this one.Pros: 1. The surround sound/atmos really awakes all senses. Even when rear speakers are attached to the Bar, the surround sound works really well.2. The woofer does not dominate the point of sound. Even when my woofer is kept in one corner of room, no one can tell where the woofer is kept. It seems all sounds are coming from TV.Cons: 1. Difficult to connect to Alexa and Internet. It takes several attempts to identify.2. The looks are too dull, and does not look good for such an expensive device.3. The voice is not so clear. I am not able to explain but somehow when it comes to songs I still prefer my 14 year old Sony Tower home theater (5.1 blue ray system) and even jbl flip 4. This Bar does justice as a home theater but not to listen to normal songs. It's better for movies and ghazal type songs. Also volume is low for Bar.

I even tested them in noisy environments, and they create an immersive, almost eerie silence that’s perfect for focus or relaxation.2. Outstanding Sound Quality:The audio quality is phenomenal. The bass is rich but never overpowering, mids are smooth, and the treble is crystal clear. Whether it’s classical, pop, or podcasts, everything sounds incredible. LDAC support and 360 Reality Audio are cherries on top for audiophiles.3. Incredible Comfort:I can wear these headphones for hours without feeling any discomfort. The earcups are plush, and the lightweight design makes them perfect for long flights or workdays.4. Smart Features:Sony thought of everything! Features like Speak-to-Chat, ambient sound control, and automatic pause when you take them off are intuitive and seamless. The touch controls are responsive, and the app customization is top-notch.5. Long Battery Life:With 30 hours of battery life, I rarely need to charge them. And when I do, the fast charging feature gives me hours of playback in just a few minutes.6. Multipoint Connectivity:Being able to connect to two devices at once is a game-changer. I can seamlessly switch between my laptop for work calls and my phone for music without missing a beat.Final Verdict:The Sony WH-1000XM4 are the ultimate noise-canceling headphones.

"I loved the Xbox Series S gaming console. The reason why I bought this console in 2021 was Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. A few things that I like about this console are:1. Small Size of the console: You can carry this console with you wherever you want by just putting it in your backpack. Yes, the size is so small. Also, I have carried it in flights in both Carry on and Checked luggage (with proper packing) and it works perfectly fine. So, the build is pretty sturdy.2. Smoothness of the games: I haven't had any problems with the smoothness of the gameplay. However, I have only played a few games like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, Forza Horizon 4 and 5, Grand Theft Auto GTA 5, Assetto Corsa etc. So, this should provide you with some idea about its capability. It doesn't support 4K, so keep that in mind.3. Controller: Still works great after 3 years, just put the XBOX recommended Lithium ion battery in it. That should last 1-2 days (daily 4-6 hours of usage) depending upon the game play. Also, battery still works great after three years.4. Game Pass: Get the subscription you may like and it provides you with adequate number of games, else you can buy the games you want to play separately.5. Storage: This is the only negative with this console and that too in a big way. The reason is, after regular game updates, I could not keep and play both the MS flight simulator 2020 and Forza Horizon 5. It only offers 512 GBs of storage of which approximately 350 GBs in available for game storage. Although FS 2024 has been released and is comparatively very small in size but its game play is heavily reliant on the internet connection. So, keep the storage capacity in mind. You can get official Xbox Series S|X storage to upgrade memory but that's expensive.6. HOTAS & Racing Wheel: HOTAS for MS Flight Simulator, designed for Xbox, work well. However, I experienced compatibility issues with my Thrustmaster racing wheel, where the steering wheel would lose feedback upon waking up the console etc. See my separate review for Thrustmaster racing wheel for more details.",5,22/12/24,xbox seriesS,9

Henry won't stay in, he gets rather disagreeable if not allowed out, frankly that's how he came to live at my brother's home. The neighborhood is cat and dog friendly but Henry has a habit of jumping inside cars, he's done at least one ride laying on the neighbor's backseat. Even though Sir Smugness is chipped we kind of wanted something a little more, hence the collar and air tag. I've got to admit it's fun to see where he goes, that he's safe, and not heading to the Jersey Shore.Part of the fun is the cat icon is a ginger cat not surprisingly Sir Henry of Smugness is also a ginger. My brother said it was easy to set up.The collar is good quality and Henry hasn't itched at it, which he tended to do with his other collars. The air tag fits snuggly in the holder. The collar is great value for money is nice looking and comes with a QR code tag and two bells. We foregoed the bells, but used the QR and air tags.

"*This is my secondary device*As a writer churning out 3,000-4,000 words daily, the MacBook Air M1 serves as a reliable secondary device. While it's not my primary workstation, it effortlessly handles my writing needs. The keyboard, with its tactile and responsive keys, is a delight to type on. However, transitioning from a Windows machine, I did encounter a learning curve with the unique macOS shortcuts.For light tasks like browsing, emailing, and word processing, the M1's snappy performance is impressive. However, when pushing it with multiple heavy-duty applications, the 8GB RAM can sometimes become a bottleneck. If you're seeking a long-term investment, the M2 variant with more RAM would be a wiser choice.Nevertheless, considering its price point of around 53k in 2024, the MacBook Air M1 offers exceptional value for money. It's a solid choice for writers, students, and casual users who need a reliable and portable device.",4,08/12/24,mac,13
"After a long search, I finally purchased the MBA M1, and it has easily been one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made.First of all, the form factor is simply stunning. It's incredibly easy to carry around in a sleeve or a backpack. There are no vents or fans, which makes it incredibly quiet and sleek.The display is gorgeous, the keyboard is fantastic, the trackpad is amazing, the speakers sound great, and the overall build quality is exceptional. Last but not least, the star of the show is the M1 processor and the battery. The M1 chip is incredibly powerful and efficient, resulting in exceptional performance and battery life.If your essential software runs on macOS, the M1 MacBook Air is a no-brainer",5,07/12/24,mac,18

Whether you're a gamer, a multimedia enthusiast, or just someone who wants a reliable smartphone for everyday use, the OnePlus 12R has you covered. Available in Cool Blue or Iron Gray, the OnePlus 12R offers two variants to choose from. While it may seem a bit pricey, starting at Rs 35,999 for 8GB + 128GB and Rs.39,999 for 16GB + 256GB.

"At first I was apprehensive.  Could just a little button tracker like this be of value?Now, after 2 years of owning multiple AirTags, I confidently can say ""Yes!  They are of value!""We now have all sets of car keys paired with an AirTag, I own a wallet that has an AirTag in the case and I keep an AirTag in my computer backpack, just in case I become separated from it while traveling.Setup of a new AirTag is easy, of course you must have an Apple device to take advantage of the AirTag.  Once it's setup, you can easily see it's location from the app on the phone.  Lost your keys?  Not an issue, the on-phone app will direct you to where they are, as long as it can connect to them.The only issue I've had is when the battery dies, I highly recommend watching a video or two to understand how best to replace the battery.  I damaged my first AirTag by thinking I needed to pry the tag open to replace the battery.If you're on the fence about buying an AirTag, just do it!",5,06/12/24,apple air tag,4

"The Apple AirTag is a useful and straightforward solution for keeping track of my belongings. Setting it up was quick and simple—just a tap to connect with my iPhone, and I was good to go. Its sleek and compact design makes it easy to attach to items like keys, bags, or even my wallet.The location tracking is precise, and the Find My app provides a clear view of the item’s location. When I need to locate something nearby, the Precision Finding feature is especially helpful. It uses haptic feedback and on-screen directions to guide me to the exact spot. The sound the AirTag emits is also loud enough to hear from a distance, which makes it easier to find items when they’re buried or hidden.The battery life is impressive, and the AirTag uses a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery, so there’s no need to replace the whole device when the battery runs low. It’s also water and dust-resistant, which adds to its durability for everyday use.While the AirTag works well for finding nearby items, if it’s far out of Bluetooth range, it depends on the broader Apple network to help locate it, which works most of the time but isn’t quite as immediate as I’d prefer in some situations.Satisfaction with Packaging: The packaging was secure, and the setup was straightforward without any issues.Likelihood of Recommending: I would recommend the AirTag to anyone who wants an easy, reliable way to track their belongings.Price Reasonableness: The price is on the higher side for a small tracker, but the quality and seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem make it a worthwhile investment.",4,30/11/24,apple air tag,34

"If you're someone who does not have the budget for the series X but wants to play all the latest and upcoming games as soon as they come out, Series S will not disappoint you. The hardware on both the series X and the series S are same, the only difference is the GPU which is 4 tera flops on series S and 12 tera flops on series X. But you won't notice much difference if you don't plan to play on 4K etc.Console is extremely quiet, which I love about it. You won't hear anything running in the console unless you literally put your cheek on the vent. For the price point, series S is an amazing machine that's very powerful and compactNOTE: It's highly likely that the power plug you'll get is european and the console most probably be imported. Not to worry, you can still claim warranty for it by contacting Microsoft. Just make sure you have the full 1 year warranty for the console when you register it on the website's your devices section. In case you don't(I didn't) get the full 365 days warranty, you can contact Microsoft chat support for the same and they'll do it for you the same day. Happy gaming!",3,30/11/24,xbox seriesS,3

"I had never used AirTags before, nor completely understood the application of AirTags to prevent theft, find your devices, or get an alert to your phone when leaving an item behind - such as your tagged wallet or keys.I tagged my keys and my wallet.  If I walk out the door without either item, I get an alert to my phone indicating I've left the item behind.  The AirTag can then by tracked by my phone and will direct me to the precise location of the item, such as my keys or wallet.Before AirTags? I used to search for items that fell behind the couch or that I dropped getting out of the car or credit cards (tagged wallet) that I left in the restaurant.  If my wallet were stolen, I would get a ""separation"" alert showing the location of the stolen wallet.  Of course, I would then immediately disable my credit cards.These provide a great piece of mind in my daily hectic life.  After I bought the first one, and learned how they worked, I bought two more (with cases) for my luggage.  You can also put a tag on your dog's collar or in your child's backpack.  The uses are endless.The price dropped from 29 dollars, or so, to 19.00 and you can get a similar discount for a 4 pack.  You won't regret it!",5,17/11/24,apple air tag,0

"After going through numerous positive reviews, I decided to invest in these high-end Sony headphones, but unfortunately, it turned out to be the wrong choice. The claimed 30-hour battery life is far from accurate. In reality, you’ll need to charge them daily for just 5-6 hours of playback time.While the audio quality is decent, it falls short on the promised bass and beats. On the brighter side, the ANC works exceptionally well. However, given the price, I feel like I’ve wasted a significant amount of money on these headphones.Edit: The charging issue is resolved after charging it a few times, and now the headphones give around 30 hours of playtime!

"The 'SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD 1TB' is a solid external drive that delivers dependable performance, though not quite as fast as its advertised speeds. While it claims up to 1050MBps read and 1000MBps write, my actual tests using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test showed around 800MBps for both read and write speeds. It's worth noting that I formatted the drive in exFAT, which is compatible with both Mac and Windows devices, as opposed to APFS (exclusive to Apple devices), which might yield higher speeds.In a real-world test, transferring a 23.65GB file to the SSD took about 47 seconds, and copying it back to my laptop took 32 seconds, both over a Type-C port. While these speeds are lower than the theoretical maximums, they're still quite fast for typical everyday use. For normal users, who aren’t constantly moving massive files, you’ll find it transfers 1GB files in a blink.If you're looking for blazing speeds, formatting it in APFS on an Apple device will give you better performance. But for most users, especially those working across platforms, the real-world speeds of around 700MBps read and 500MBps write in exFAT are more than adequate. Overall, this SSD is a good balance of portability and speed—perfect for everyday use!",4,18/10/24,mixed dataset.csv,9

But, considering the price (I paid 35k INR, 8gb+256gb) I don't think there can be anything better than this. Maybe S23 is a better option if you want a better camera around this range but maybe 5-6k higher than this if you want 256gb. I didn't want 16GB ram on this as I don't think I need it and I don't think anyone does for now. I have used an iPhone 15 128gb earlier this year. Maybe my standards for camera are high. But, let's be honest; value is great for the price. Go for it, safe bet for 2 years. I might switch after 1-2 years. Oh yeah, doesn't heat; only slightly that too while charging; again it is a 100W charger. Butter smooth scrolling as it supports LTPO & fingerprint scanner is quick too. 4 stars cause camera might disappoint you. I suggest you to consider this, if under 35K INR and that too 256+8!",4,17/10/24,mixed dataset.csv,46

"I’ve been using the OnePlus 12R (Iron Gray, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB Storage) for a week now, and it’s been an amazing experience so far!Design & Feel:The Iron Gray color looks really sleek, and the phone feels great in the hand. It’s light, and slim, and the metal finish gives it a premium feel. I’ve gotten a few compliments on how good it looks!Performance:This phone is super fast. I’ve been using it for gaming, browsing, and even some work, and it handles everything like a pro. No lag, no stuttering — everything runs so smoothly. The 8 GB RAM really shows its power when multitasking.Display:The AMOLED screen is beautiful! Watching videos and scrolling through social media is a real treat. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the smooth 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel so responsive.Battery Life:The battery easily lasts me the whole day stiil I have around 20-25% left, even with heavy use. I also love how fast it charges — the SUPERVOOC charging gets me back to 100% in about 25-30 minutes, which is super convenient. But I guess, better to use slow charger day to day to increase battery life and use the SUPERVOOC only when you need it urgently.Camera:I was skeptic about 12R vs Realme GT 6T vs Pixel 8A. After a thorough review and physical check, the dynamic range is better in 12R. Pixel is also a great camera but has a small battery backup compared to 12R. I can vouch that 12R will not disappoint you with its overall performance. I’ve taken some really sharp and detailed photos, and the portrait mode is a lot of fun. Even in low light, the pictures come out pretty good.Software:I love how clean and simple the OxygenOS is. It’s easy to navigate and doesn’t come with a lot of pre-installed apps I don’t need. Everything just works smoothly, and I’ve had no issues so far.After 7 days, I’m really happy with the OnePlus 12R. It feels like a flagship phone at the price. Definitely a great choice if you’re looking for a reliable camera, battery backup, feature-packed, good-looking phone!",5,17/10/24,mixed dataset.csv,12

"My word of advice.. stay away from buying phones on Amazon!!!I was recently delivered a defective one plus 12R that won't even turn on and Amazon has entirely shirked their responsibility. They washed their hands off claiming it's a One plus issue, and I need to deal this directly with the manufacturer. They won't let you return/replace it or take any action for that matter. Apparently, it's clearly mentioned in their policy that Amazon is not responsible for defective products even if it arrives Dead. Beware of this interesting clause guys!!!!If you’re unlucky enough to get a faulty device, brace yourself for a nightmare. Be prepared to be put on hold for hours and hours, transferred through never ending loops of mind games, bad attitudes and utmost unprofessional behaviour of the Amazon staff.. ranging from the agents to technicians to leadership team. This ridiculous drama will drag on for days, driving you to the brink of insanity - forcing you to either give up or become one of them... Insane! I chose the former and now find myself with a non-working phone, a loss of 45k INR, and just a sliver of sanity left!To be honest, I’ve always bought all my phones and gadgets from Amazon. However, I feel compelled to write this not just because of a one-off bad experience, but because I’ve realized that this is a widespread issue. Countless others have faced this nightmare, particularly during a ""SALE"".Do yourself a favor: don’t waste your money here. Go to a showroom!Good luck guys!",5,15/10/24,mixed dataset.csv,32

     Soothing.My first order for the same product was automatically returned back to the seller. It was a good incident as the serial number of the MacBook pertaining to that order was already in use. The warranty of that product started 5 days before the order was placed for the same. Hence it’s a caution ⚠️ —- Do check your warranty using the serial no of the product before you accept the product. It might happen that everything is packed and sealed but the product which you’re receiving is already a returned product or a used one. Beware of this. Just make sure you check the warranty using the serial number that it’s not yet started while you’re receiving it and you are good to go. This time my product is genuine hence sharing the video. This is my second macbook. My first MacBook Pro m1 13 inch had an auto shutdown issue after 3 years of usage fixing which was costlier than getting this hence I ordered this. I hope it goes well. Hopefully this will last long . 🤞",4,15/10/24,mac,66

I do not face any lags when the setting are on high and the details of the game look much clearer.3. Look and feel of the phone physically is great.4. Charging is pretty good. Love the fast charging of one plus and the battery life is pretty good tooCons1. The UI isn't the best. My old phone was a Samsung and the amount of customisation I used to have doesn't even compare to one plus. I really wanted to switch back to my old phone just for this one problem.

"I recently purchased the Xbox Series S from Amazon, and I couldn’t be more pleased with my decision! The console offers an incredible gaming experience at a very affordable price point. Setting it up was a breeze, and the sleek, compact design fits perfectly in my setup without taking much space.The performance is top-notch, with fast load times thanks to the SSD. Games run smoothly, and the graphics are stunning, even without 4K. I’ve been able to dive right into popular titles like Forza Horizon and Halo Infinite with no lag or issues. The quick resume feature is a game-changer—it allows me to switch between multiple games effortlessly!Game Pass is another big win.

"It's a good product from JBL who are world leaders in audios. The output is ideal for a mid sized room, the lows are picked up well by the woofer, which is more of a Punchy sound rather than a Boomy one.  Easy to set up.  In my opinion,.I wonder, is the output really 590 watts as claimed?  I personally felt the Woofer, rated by JBL at 300 watts should have been more powerful.  But this may be a personal choice.

"I got the delivery on time with the original Box and Seal and the product. Now about the OnePlus 12R it's a silent-killer phone in speed, weight and feel in hand a good Value for money. It's fingerprint reader amazingly fast response. The functionality is superb with a massive 3.2Ghz clock speed Snapdragon 8Gen2. The feel of OnePlus 12R is premium and luxury in hand. My final verdicts are:CAMERA : Above average. Portrait mode too good. Night mode is ok. Dynamic and wide angle can be more good in future update as I hope.CHARGING & BATTERY: Like Nord series this also have 5500mAh and comes easily 1 and half for me under 5G for 7 hrs or mild gaming. There is no idle discharge also. 100% charging happens in just 12 to 13 minutes with Ultra Fast 100w charger thanks to OnePlus they give it in the box only.DISPLAY: Its LTPO4 Amoled and immersive feel of color and subject be movie watching or gaming the Display of OnePlus 12R will attract you more and more.BUILD & BODY: Looks sturdy 💪 and it is durable also the way it looks with Waterproof and dust proof you don't need to bother for splashes of rain water etc. Moreover OnePlus is giving one Backcase in box also.RAM: I loved the ram management of OnePlus 12R it's not heating or lagging at all, even during 60fps gaming or multitasking or even video editing also. Only on charging only it heats but overall during the gaming it's not heating that much. Ram expansion feature makes the mobile more battery efficient.NETWORK: Till date I have not faced any call drops or Wifi Break in middle. Even wirless bluetooth earbuds calling also too good and stereophonic.SOUND & HAPTICS: Dual Stereo Speakers and Dolby sound makes the music on the go nice and loud and mild bass and crisp clear. The HAPTICS of OnePlus 12R is truly impressive with its O Engine feature. The typing is a boon on it with fluid speed and every word auto-correction feature that enables a fast typing as well as 99% accuracy.At the end I can easily say that it's a premium smartphone as per the price, with its fully loaded AI features with a new 2.26Gb update, it is well justified. Every phone has a CONS & PROS but about OnePlus 12R it's Cons are less for example - it can be IP67 rest I am not finding any cons as per budget I have paid.Highly recommended.

"I've lost 2 different pairs of in-ear TWS earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so I decided to buy something large and harder to lose (lol). It was between this and the Bose QC45 for me. My primary headphones for 8 years now are the Audio Technica ATH-M50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so I'll use those as a reference for audio quality.Short read: Why I picked this over the Bose QC45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. I don't want people knowing I'm carrying around pricey headphones so I'd rather have a pair of plain looking Sonys than a Bose pair that screams expensive. Also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. I wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- Amazing battery: LDAC + DSEE Extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. Nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses USB-C).- Audio: Super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. I EQd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. It's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.It has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. I'm including an EQ preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). Compared to the M50x, they have much better bass so anyone into EDM will like this set as well.- Comfort: They're wonderfully comfortable. Super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. The cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. Orders of magnitude more comfortable than my M50x, and easily the best other than the Bose QC line. You'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- ANC: They completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, ACs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. Makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. Voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. I don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so I'm not particular about it. I can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- Multipoint: works as advertised, I was able to use it fine with my Samsung Galaxy phone and Macbook pro upon testing. I don't use this feature though since I prefer LDAC and that is only possible with multi-point off. However if MP is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.Conclusion: If you can afford these headphones, I would easily recommend them to you. They sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. The ANC is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. It's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. They also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (I got it for INR ~15,500). It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. Cheers.",5,24/08/24,mixed dataset.csv,71

"Kellogg's Muesli Fruit, Nut & Seeds has become my absolute favorite breakfast choice! This 750g pack is packed with a perfect blend of multigrains, dried fruits, nuts, and seeds, making it a powerhouse of nutrition. Each bite is a delightful mix of crunchy and chewy textures, with just the right amount of sweetness from the fruits.What I love most is how filling and satisfying it is. It keeps me energized throughout the morning without feeling heavy. The mix of oats, wheat, corn, and barley, combined with almonds, raisins, and seeds, offers a balanced meal that’s rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Plus, it’s incredibly versatile – I enjoy it with milk, yogurt, or even as a topping for smoothies.Knowing that it’s India’s No. 1 Muesli gives me confidence in its quality. Kellogg's has truly nailed it with this 12-in-1 power breakfast. It’s not just a cereal, but a wholesome start to the day. Highly recommended for anyone looking to kickstart their mornings with something delicious and nutritious! And I have recommended this to my family, friends and relatives they started using it and they are very satisfied with this. They are loving each and every bit of it and they are buying it regularly!!",5,14/08/24,Kellogg's Muesli,9

"Most Regretful buy. Wear detection didn't work out of box. Amazon refused to return. Forced to visit store which was 20 kms away. The the technician has no knowledge of what's wear detection. Says it's working fine ? What's the problem. Finally after wasting another 30 minutes checking, opening and cleaning ( brand new device) is a joke in the name ""sony"" brand. The technician was so casual about having such a pathetic product quality. Asked to wait 8 days for the return device. However called after few hours said it's a ""technical glitch"" with device software? Having said that asked me to come back to store and pick the ""glitchy"" device. So I went again to travel the same store. The so called technician handed me over the device as if it was.my fault the device was of pathetic quality. Said sir you have bought very old model of the headphones and will have issues. So it's my fault the for not choosing updated model? And sony no longer stocks/manufacturers the model anymore. And asked me to quietly leave as the device is now working.Same was the attitude from the so called guy I spoke to the Sony's customer service as I tried to complain. He said there's nothing to complain as the device is working fine and threatened to leave the store.Also Multipoint connection is another blunder. Stupid headphones won't even connect in one go. Have to restart many times to get connected to a device after switching from different device.I can safely say crapy quality and worst customer service I have experienced from such a brand.Indeed overrated in the market.

This device seems to have excellent heat dissipation abilities, evidenced by very hot air it spits out. It has limited storage capacity, though low storage capacity has been mitigated by 1TB external SSD I bought seperately. However, external storage can only be used to play older games, newer games can only be played if they are on built-in storage.This means you can store downloaded new updated games on external storage device but have to transfer it back to internal storage when wanting to play.

Not the greatest out there but one of the best ones.* There are few hidden features to this phone sprcifically which don't come for even I-phones.* Another point to camera is that the CRI is much better with oneplus than with I phone. Pics taken by I phone always have a warmer output than what it really is.Problems that need to be addressed* Heating is not as bad as other phones but still needs to be improved.* Would be great if magnetic charging is included.* Front camera even though it is 16mp it doesn't record 4k videos.* Display glass is prone to smaller scratches very soon.

"Purchased it after receiving positive reviews from various online platforms and youtube reviewers. Received this on May 10, 2023. But, after almost a year of usage I can tell that this is at best a very hyped expensive okayish product with poor build quality.The right hinge swivel broke within a year while putting on the headphones, which is weird as one expects good build quality from products which are in the premium price segment. Sony does not cover this damage under their 1 yr standard warranty. I've not been able to get this repaired as few authorised centers refuse to repair it and others want me to shell out INR 5k-6k.Although, it is priced around the 20k price band in India, it does not deliver a premium experience. Some brands deliver a better audio output at a lower price band. It's difficult to wear these for longer stretches as the ears accumulate sweat. The adaptive noise cancellation misfires most of the time which gets irritating with usage. It does not block out the room fan noise. Also, some distant noises would always get into the noise cancellation spectrum. The mic is decent during phone calls. The overall audio experience and build quality does not justify the price one pays for this product.Hence, avoid if you can.",3,27/04/24,mixed dataset.csv,3

"Audio Quality is great. These headphones sound amazing but the problem is they're tuned out of the box. It doesn't feel like they product neutral sound like many other headphones. But this is fine, you can always adjust the EQ, and Sony's tuning isn't bad (it'll satisfy most users).Mic quality is pretty bad. I don't understand how such an expensive has poor mic quality. It sounds like a mic from a cheap TWS earbud. This headphone isn't for calls or meetings. The mic quality is only a part of the problem. It doesn't have a sidetone feature. You can't hear yourself talking while in a call. Trust  me, you don't used to this (you shouldn't). It feels weird and in most cases, you'll end up talking louder than you should, just to satisfy your brain.I use multi-point connectivity. I can keep the headphone connected to phone and PC at the same time. When I receive a call on a device, it automatically switches to that device. I wish the call experience on this headphone was better.Battery life is great as expected. It lasts days for my usage. It lasts even longer when I turn off ANC.It's also very comfortable to wear this headset.I also like it that you can just fold the headset and place it on the table. It takes less space and doesn't need a stand. The carry case is also nice.The cables Sony provides with the headset are really short. I don't know why a billion dollar company like Sony does this with their expensive product lineup.One of the things I really liked about this headphones is that Sony's app doesn't require you to create an account and grant it permission to everything on the phone like some other brands.

"I bought the 16gb 256gb variant on first day sale for 46k and got oneplus buds z2 for free as well as 2300 cashback as I used amazon pay icici credit card.I wanted a overall balanced phone with good OS, premium feel and good camera.Pros :- No bloatware- Black color has matt finish, and has good inhand feel and gets no fingerprints on the back- Fingerprint scanner is placed properly for easy reach and is fast- The phone is very fast and snappy for everyday use- I am getting 2 days of battery life on light usage, 1.5 days on moderate usage. Can't say for heavy usage as I don't play games anymore but it should last a whole day even with gaming.- Cameras seem decent for the price, OIS, edge detection and everything working good.- No heating issues or any other problems faced so far in around 40 days of usage.- Phone charges from 20% to 100% in 15 to 20 minutes. Make sure to enable smart charging in settingsCons :- Cameras seem to replicate colors as washed out. Especially red color seems washed out. It is not very noticeable though.- Oxygen OS even though is bloat free, there was a wallpaper carousel on lock screen when swiping right and even switching it off was still showing that screen on right swipe, with an option to turn it on again just like glance in realme phones. I had to find it in settings > apps and uninstall wallpaper carousel from there to remove it.Also, on home screen when swiped right the google news feed shows and there is no way to remove that screen. For now I have disabled the google app from settings and it has gone, but disabling google app also disables google lens and voice assistant.

"Easily one of the best purchases that I have made and well worth its price.Pros:- SD 8 Gen 2 is fast and very power efficient. The performance is indistinguishable in day to day usage when compared to SD 8 Gen 3 on a OnePlus 12 with UFS 4.0. Even though the 12R has a UFS 3.1 storage, you are unlikely to notice any difference whatsoever without running benchmarks or checking the specifications. In real life day to day usage, I have not found any difference and I am a power user who uses a lot of applications and use the phone over 8 Hours a day.- The vapour chamber handles the cooling very well which keeps the device at excellent temperature even when playing games for an extended duration. It almost never goes over 38c.- The display has the same features as the OnePlus 12 (the resolution is relatively lower but it's not noticeable to the naked eye without magnification) and this is one of the best displays that you will come across. The HDR performance is also some of the best I have seen and it is a completely different experience. This can also be seen in the HDR shots taken with cameras. I'd suggest going to a OnePlus experience center and searching for 12K HDR videos on YouTube to get a better idea. Note that the 4,500 nits mentioned is only the HDR brightness at a small white portion of the display under sunlight. This is NOT the max brightness of the full display. But it is bright enough to use under direct sunlight.- Battery life is very impressive with over 8 hours of SOT and the 100W included charger fully charges it in about 35 mins.- Also love that the display can be used even when your hands are wet unlike most other smartphones- The bezels are extremely slim and the chin is smaller than the one on the OnePlus 12. I do wish it was equal all around though.Rather than cons, I'll just mention what it lacks.- Wireless charging- Telephoto cameraThat's pretty much it. If you are looking for a smooth and reliable device with solid performance, battery life, fast charging, decent cameras and display experience, I would easily recommend this.

But after researching some articles like ratings.com there i found with the help of a lots of graphs and rating that M4's have slightly better sound staging than the XM4's. But its not a huge difference like which they have in their price. But the difference was in their ANC's like XM4's totally destroy the M4's in ANC department.Particularly, If I talk about the WH-1000XM4's then I'll say just go for it. Its sound quality is just phenomenal. It sounds like... means that should be sound in actual. The bass is not boomyy, muddy or over done. Bass comes when its required only with proper kick's. Mids and treble are also done very well, you can easily point out each and every instruments of music or songs. ANC is amazing too indeed.

Which means when the bass is in the highest setting of ""5"", it's just puking out loud noise instead of actual bass.",3,29/12/23,JBL Bar 500 Pro Dolby Atmos,14
"An outstanding product for anyone. I own a seagate external HD before this but this thing is fast and light. I know the device is small but when I saw/handle it actually, I simply laugh as it was too small but the build quality was second to none.It comes with exFat file system so it works on my laptop as well as on my Mac automatically. It works faster on my Mac though. A 20+ GB file took 30-40 sec approx.My main reason for buying this product is to get rid of iCloud subscription which I did on monthly basis which is a headache. And believe me the more storage space (iCloud) you buy the little it feels as it fills up space quite rapidly in no time. Now I have ended my monthly subscription totally.One thing I don't like is that it heats up quite fast but it was during my first usage transferring huge old files.",5,28/12/23,mixed dataset.csv,8
"I have used Bose QC35 for 4 years. They are durable, have excellent call quality and fits perfectly to my head. However they have a terrible app and I have faced bluetooth connection issues.Recently I bought Sony WH-1000XM4 hoping that this will be a good replacement. I would say I'm a little disappointed. The product itself looks durable and has excellent call quality and sound quality. However, I have had issues with connection issues. If I leave the room, the sound is lost but the computer shows that the bluetooth is connected. This has become a pain as I have never faced this issue in my Bose headphones.

"I recently purchased these headphones, and while they are undoubtedly the best of their kind, I must caution those who don't want to feel like they're in their own world, cut off from the outside.

However, if you're all about exceptional sound quality and don't minod the isolation, these headphones are an outstanding choice.Fit: These headphones are incredibly comfortable and provide a secure fit, ensuring they stay in place during any activity.Voice Quality: The audio quality is second to none, delivering crisp, clear, and immersive sound. Whether you're a music enthusiast or use them for calls, you won't be disappointed.Size: They strike the perfect balance between being compact and still offering fantastic features. You can easily carry them with you wherever you go.Durability: These headphones are built to last, with robust construction that can withstand the test of time and use.Portability: Their sleek design and foldable structure make them highly portable.

"I must admit I was so very confused between Xm4 and Xm5 model of sony headsets but then I asked few basic questions to myself like main purpose of purchase and usage, my answer was Xm4 considering the price point I had to pay for Xm5. My usage is mainly around watching TV, listening to music and few calls (usage frequency is very low).Please note since I am no expert so my ratings below are totally my opinion and personal experience. Xm5 surely blows out xm4 when it comes to ANC and few other added features, rest xm4 has been best for a reason from last few years. If you love bass xm4 will give you more puch than xm5. Plus portability wise xm4 is ahead of xm5, though xm5 looks more premium but it takes more space and has a bigger carry pouch since it does not fold. Neither of the products are waterproof so be careful when taking it out for workout (excessive sweat may cause a damage) or plan to step out while it rains.Bass: 4.5/5Clarity: 4/5Portability: 4.5/5ANC: 4/5Call Quality: 4/5Since Xm5 is selling like hot cake in the market I just thought I would share my experience with both of the headsets. I did try them at Croma before buying it off on Amazon.",4,27/10/23,mixed dataset.csv,2
"Overall, I am happy with the Product.The console looks new and unused which is the basic requirement.But the seal was tampered which made the product look fishy to me. Like why was it broken?Also, I received Hong Kong version of Xbox and foreign power cord. That was not nice from the seller. Indian version would have been ideal.For those who receive this version, do not exchange. Instead, buy a separate power cord for Indian sockets. If exchanged, they will give a used product which is not ideal.Overall, you can buy this.

"1. Performance:The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.2. Battery Life:One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.3. Fanless Design:The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.4. Portability:The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.5. Compatibility:The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.6. Rosetta 2:Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.7. Price:The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.8. Integrated Graphics:The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.9. Limited Port Selection:The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.10. Upgradability:The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase.",5,19/10/23,mac,187

"I know there is no point comparing TWS like AirPods pro to these headphones as they both are very different but most buyers might have a fixed budget like me in which they could either go for some good TWS or Headphones.I was first leaning towards AirPods pro 2 but later on changed my mind because -1. AirPods have a fixed battery life (not taking about discharge timing), your Airpods might only last for couple of years when you will start noticing a significant degradation in battery health. Moreover, it will end up in landfill as you can’t get its battery replaced. On the other hand, In headphones like these you can get the battery replaced and moreover you can use them in ‘wired mode’ (AUX cable included) without a battery!2. Bigger drivers = more vivid sound, I am not an Audiophile but in my experience and usage I have felt that the headphones generally produce a more pleasing sound. (it could be a personal preference)Pros about XM4 -1. Good built quality, soft to touch but still rigid at the same time.2. Very comfortable for long listening sessions.3. Multi device connectivity, you can simultaneously connect it to two devices! That in my opinion is a must feature in a premium headphone. You would just need to install the proprietary application in one device and connect the headphones to any secondary device using the app, after that you can control the volume, eq and much more from your primary device (using the app). Device switching is also very smooth.4. Noise cancellation and transparency mode is also very good, keeping in mind the various modes you could choose from the app according to your liking.5. Battery life, I have to never worry about the battery life as it could last for days with heavy use and above that you can put it on charging for short intervals of time whenever you are not using it as it supports fast charging.6. Proprietary Application, the Sony app for these headphones comes with so many little tweaks and settings that could provide you with very personal experience according to your liking.Cons about XM4 -1. Can get hot, as they are closed back headphone so you could feel your ears warming up during long listening sessions.2. Might be a little big for you, as they are over the ear headphones so they may look a little big on ur head but you will get used to it eventually.3. No water resistance, so you may not be very suitable for gym during sweaty workout sessions.Overall I would highly recommend these headphones if you have the budget and you are looking for something which would last for years to come. Sound quality is amazing, fit and finish is on point, very comfortable for long sessions. I myself was using TWS in past and switching to wireless headphones was a great decision.",5,02/09/23,mixed dataset.csv,22
"My god, where was this my entire life. Have put half my Steam library and all of my battle.net library on it, still has space. Bye bye to space issuesPros- Lightweight? Its literally weightless, actually thought I got an empty box when i received it and recorded the unsealing of the package :)- Fast!!! Tho not blazing, but can comfortably play games from it. However, fast paced multiplayer games must NOT be played on this, as it can have certain lag- Can be used with phones and tablets as well, now carrying my entire book, movie and music collection with me for on-the-go entertainment!!- Wire is very short and is sturdy, port is sturdy as well. Usb C to USB C, thus no proprietary carp in the middle- ALWAYS detects with the same drive letter every time on my laptop. So much more convenient, as then i do not have to manually change the drive assignment every time I connect itCons:- Not a con per se, but see if you have a USB 3.0 port, it will give the fast transfer rates only then, else will be constrained by the max data transfer speed of your USB port- Online reviews in the US have noted a high rate of failures of this disk and that they are clearing them off for a discount because of this. Thus, would recommend not using as a primary backup- Wire is very short, thus leading to the drive hanging from it when connected to a portable device like a phone. Drive is light, so not too much strain on the port, but still need to be carefulGreat buy for on the go backup and entertainment!!",5,01/09/23,mixed dataset.csv,56
"I bought this product specifically for its support for 256‐bit AES hardware encryption. While it works fine on my Windows laptop and MacBook, it doesn't work on Android! There is no Android app that will unlock this device when connected to an Android device. This is a bummer because Samsung has an Android app for its T7 Touch (which should work for T7 Shield too), and this helps me access files on the encrypted (password protected) disk using my mobile phone too. But on this SanDisk, I can unlock them only on a PC (Windows or Mac) but NOT on an Android device because there is no way to 'unlock' it.If your usage is without encryption, then it will work on Android too.

"Well, this is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones it is bit annoying for me that my ears are feeling little bit of air pressure difference while on noise cancelling mode. Maybe over a period of time. I will get a adaptation to this new technology.About sound qualityThey are loud enough & having bit more Bass heavy sound signature, Maybe out of the box you won’t find the perfect sound for yourself but after playing with sony connect app, you’ll find a perfect sound signature for your ears.About noise cancellationIt is good, but do not expect out of the world experience. It reduces down many low frequency noise but cannot give you 100% isolation feeling.Look and feel of the productO boy i am in love with the look and feel of the product, They feels so premium. Even I prefer MX4 design over MX5. Design is only the reason I went for MX4 instead of MX5.Comfort levelThey are the most comfortable headphones. I have ever used till now here design of the headphone makes it most comfortable for long listening sessions so no complains about comfort.Should we purchase xm4 in 2023As per my point of view, every new technology comes with little bit of here and there improvement and will charge you bunch of money for it where little old technology comes with great price point and almost 90% of features. So this is the best deal you can crack in 2023.Purchase adviceIf you have any store near your home, where you can experience both XM5 and XM4, then do experience it before purchasing it then make your decision because each and every person have their own sound signature preference you should experience by yourself to know which is your preference.",5,07/08/23,mixed dataset.csv,4
"I have a PS4, due to PS5 shortage at the time I bought XBOX Series S. Perfect console for me, I don't get time to play much now a days due to work and I play mostly only on weekends. With XBOX Gamepass this is just the best. It can play older XBOX 360 games like RDR1, GTA 4, All the old CODs, TimeSplitters, Fable 1, 2, 3, etc but you do have to buy them from the XBOX store (no disc) and most of them are on the XBOX pass also.

"After a long research, I finally chose XM4 over XM5. I could have spent extra 10k if that was worth it. But few pointers that help me choosing XM4 are:-1. XM4 has better ratings than XM5 at Amazon.2. Reddit, YT, Blogs say XM5 isn't really a successor but just a competitor with slight improvements like slighter better ANC, Call quality. If you're not an Audio Engineer or a Music creator - these slight improvements wouldn't matter to you much.3. XM4 is more compact. Foldable in a hand-sized pouch.I purchased Sony XM4 headphones during the Great Indian Sale for around 20k.This review is after few hours of usage.Sound quality 🔊 - Best in classANC - Powerful💪Comfort - GreatGrip - Satisfactory (can't run with these:)Yes it's true that you can clearly hear every instruments sound. It's made for people who listen songs for a long time. Earlier  have used Realme ANC-earbuds, they hurt ear. But this doesn't at all. These have touch screen gesture controls on right side - really stylish to use. One great feature I liked is you can swiftly switch back and forth between Transparent and ANC mode by placing your hand on the right side cup. I would conclude by saying as a music lover it was really a dream come true to finally own the Sony premium ANC headphones.-1 star because while walking the speakers flickers a lot.

It's available storage around 360-70gb but trust me guys if you play 2-3 games per day.... There is not a such issue...For me I play 2 games. One is forza horizon 5 and one is story based game.

"Please, I have nothing else to say about this absolutely lovely pair of luxury listening headphones, YouTubers will explain you why this is one of the world's best wireless noise cancellation headphones!One thing - Without noise cancellation these headphones for it's audio quality is nothing special, the audio quality of these headphones are not bad but not as good as I thought it should be for it's price before receiving it... But man is the noise cancellation something... I have tried it inside a party with 4 loud speakers booming and I have stood in front of it (where I could feel all the thumps on my chest) and whole wearing these headphones with no music playing it already was cancelling our atleast 50% of the noise (music by the 4 loudspeakers) and after playing music through it, car bassy one at full volume on YouTube music streaming at 256kbps... Damn it blocked 80% of the the speaker noise 💀One more thing that as these are proper LDAC headphones, please have Spotify or Tidal subscription if you want the full experience of these amazing pair, cause as an audiophile myself I did notice huge improvement over these two music services at their premium subscription compared to before. And this is on Bluetooth, if you feel like it's not that loud enough or whatever it is, you still have that aux option via pc (while connecting it to phone unless you have a good dac on your phone, it's not recommended as most pc motherboards have much better dac than phones)That's it, what are you waiting for?

It's amazing as it has always been)I was excited to experience it and set it up ASAP.The moment I take it out of the packaging, right off the bat, I could notice that it was not new. Even at this point, my elation got the better of me, and I ignored it.Here is the list of issues:1. Not a new Product - The main seal to open the box was taken off and pasted back because it came off so easily.2. United States variant (image attached) - On the cover, it says that it's only for the distribution within United States. It means that I cannot claim any warranty for this product if I face any issues in the future.3. United States Electric Outlet Plug (image attached) - This confirms my above point because that plug is practically useless in India. We do not have sockets built for that.4. No batteries with Controller - The AA battery always comes in a separate seal. It was missing. This again proves my 1st point that it’s not a new product.I never get to open the console because I do not see any point in doing that.The seller is 'Infinity Games'. Now, I have to spend days coordinating with the Amazon team to get this resolved and place the order again.Overall, there was hardly anything left to ruin the excitement and experience of owning a console.",1,30/04/23,xbox seriesS,16

"I literally had a crush on it since it launched but couldn't afford it that time tbh but irony start when xm5 launched and now am able to buy any of them,I had started comparing both xm4s & xm5s got to know some differentiator which might help you guys choosing out your ideal daily driver!Looks:- boy o boy i cannot resist how cool this beige coloured xm4 looks in real! One of my main concern to look stand out at airport and it delivered 😁Comfort:- i had compared both headphones at croma so that i could feel which ear cushioning suits me the most and tbh xm4s have slightly thicker cups than that of xm5s, also headband feels more comfortable but won't deny xm5 headband feels more snugg and reliable. On the flip side while using my xm4 in gym it feels bit slippery on ears while sweating and you'll definitely feel some heft of your head after using it for long periods like 2-3 hrsBattery:- I use them very frequently so in my case it almost lasts for about 20hr without anc & ambient control on but have heard many times people saying it last around 30hrs too idk maybe it's just mine which is hungry of being charged frequently lolBest part Sound:- if you're an audiophile my clear suggestion would be No! Don't buy these, the default sound of these headphones are trash feels like sound is muffled and you won't be able to differentiate any highs lows and mids , only rescuver is sony headphones app's bright settings then you'd start feel like my 20k hasn't wasted the bass is literally overpowering that why i bought them because i mostly use it gym or while traveling and when i compared it with xm5s this literally overshadowed xm5s bass like a champ so my suggestion would be go for airpods 2 or xm5 for balanced sound, bose 700 for audiophile and xm4 for gym heavies and bass loversThe xm4 journey is a loop you'll return from where you started i have called it an ""undeniable crush"" because you can't resist from its look and feel also case and foldability (for some audience) but have to live with the pain of not so sharp vocals and balanced sound and last but not least the ambient control is trash i mean literally trash! Even it creates fake a fan's air noise and you'll feel wtf? So it upto you guy if these are your crush then you'd end up having these despite knowing the reality nonetheless.

The X and S are almost the same, if u r not into 4k go for it. u couldn't notice the difference between HD and 4k unless you're nitpicking. The combact factor and it's overall design attracted me. The storage is not a problem for me coz i don't play like many games at a time.In brief, the SS is just awesome.

Yes, it doesnt output 4K, but from a decent distance you can hardly tell any difference, unless youre pixel peeping. The graphics still look amazing, and most newer games Ives played, play at almost constant 60fps. Plus Xbox Game Pass is a blessing, the collection there is great.

Build quality: Excellent build quality. Soft touch finish looks and feels very premium. Earcups are soft and comfortable. Clamping force is very balanced. Hard shell carrying case is of very good quality.Sound quality: Out of the box sound quality is poor for its price. Bass is muddy and vocals are suppressed. Treble is harsh and sibilant.After stressing it for few hours and using EQ the sound quality improved significantly. But it's still average to above average for its price range.Using custom EQ improved vocals and instruments greatly. Bass is ample on these pair and using EQ improves it's tightness and muddiness.Instrument separation is very good. You can hear every instrument clearly.Sound stage is narrow. It's only slightly wider than earphones.Noise cancellation: Excellent noise cancellation. Removes almost all low frequency sounds and greatly reduces vocals and highs. Easily on of the best noise cancellation performance on the market for the price.Ambient mode: Average quality of ambient mode. The sound doesn't feel natural it has very digital or processed feel to it. You can hear everything clearly tho.Battery life: good battery life. I have to charge it once a week. Gives me about 20hrs on ldac. Note that 30hrs specified by company is with ANC and speak to chat on off.Features:  Gesture control is very good. Tap and swipe gestures work really well but it's not 100% accurate.Can connect to multiple devices.Headphones app from Sony is very good and provide with decent amount of setting. You can adjust everything these headphones through this app.Pros: Industry leading active noise cancellation.Excellent build quality.Very comfortable.Decent battery lifeGood sound quality (after EQ adjustment)Cons: Sound quality could have been better.Battery life is on lower side compared to other headphones in similar price range.Can get sweaty after prolonged use in warmer climates.Note: I bought these in great festival sale for 16.5k rupees.,4,28/10/22,mixed dataset.csv,6
"I’ve been using this headphone for almost 10 days now. The sound quality and the bass are great, best in class I would say for this price range.Pros:1. Superior sound quality, good for movies and music2. Best in class ANC3. Excellent battery backup4. Build quality and matte finish are top notch5. Touch controls are very helpful, you can do most of the work without touching your laptop or mobile.Cons:1. The call quality is not up to the mark, the side tone feature is enabled by default and there is no option to switch it off.Sidetone meaning: it’s an additional or unwanted feature. Which enables you to listen to the environment and your own voice to some extent. Just to ensure you are not shouting during calls.All other brands like JBL and Bose have option to disable this but in Sony it’s not optional. Irritating most of the times2. The box or the case, congested. You have to get used to bending your headphone every time you put it into the case.3. The charging cable. Very small and not very useful unless you charge your headphone using a power bank.4. The AUX cable doesn’t have a mic. For this price range Sony could have easily added a mic in aux.5. The App, quite buggy. Inconsistent connectivity. Sometime even though the phone is connected to headphone the app shows it’s not connected.6. No option to mute the mic with the touch controls.In spite of so many cons I would still rate this 4 star just for the quality of sound it produces.Note: Buy this if you are music lover. If you are looking for an headphone for office or business calls then I would suggest you can better go for Bose 700.",4,09/10/22,mixed dataset.csv,12
"I have been using these for two weeks now, I found them super useful.So first of all Noise cancellation, Which is very good. I usually use it while reading or focusing on tasks in the office.I won't say Noise cancellation is perfect. But it cuts out almost everything that is noise. Like, When I have it on, I can hear my friend speaking next to me but everything else is just muted, like fan sound, wind, vehicles outside, etc.  It has touch controlls which can be used to change volume and change songs. or play or pause. or even pick up call.  And It also has this feature of speech detection, which might be useful to some people. So whenever you speak something it will turn off noise cancellation for a moment to let you hear others and let yourself be heard. For me it's not that useful, I found it annoying sometimes. So i keep it off. There's another way of talking with others, Just place your hand on right earphone when someone is saying something to you, It automatically turn on ambience mode which you will be able to hear the surroundings and as soon as you remove your hand, again Noise cancellation.The music quality is amazing. It supports hires lossless audio. I use apple music and I am even able to play 24bit 96Hz audio with so much clarity. You will hear every tune. speaking of hearing every tune...It supports two device connections at once, So If you are listening to music on your PC, and someone calls you on phone it automatically swiches output from phone, and again with it's touch controls on right side of hearphones you can pick up the call.Mic quality is decent. i won't say most amazing sound but it's good enough with noise cancellation. I had to replace the headphones once because the once i received had mic issues, But even replacement was so easy from Amazon.Battery life is according  to sony is 30Hrs, in real life I can see It's pretty good, I use it regularly, I have to charge every 2 days. But also it depends on how much use I have in a day. All around it's good. And the carrying bag is very useful.Plus it's not limited to iPhones or Androids like some headphones and earbuds do. So it's a plus. It has all features accessible from both android and iOS.",5,07/10/22,mixed dataset.csv,0
"Feedback after 2 months of usage.Well what do i say. Prolonged working hours add to stress on your back. Wired headsets ensure you are leashed to you system, moreover they add stress on your ears. I spend 6-7 hours everyday over calls/online meetings. Suddenly the bulb in my head blipped and i just picked up Sony WH 1000MX4.Bonkers. Now I am u leashed. I can walk from my cabin to next without my system while still connected to my calls/meetings.The look and feel of the entire product is luxe. Ear sponge is super comfy and does not cause problem for couple of hours. But if u keep it on for hours without a break, you may feel discomfort around your ear. And that is how nature built human body.ANC is amazing. You wont even know if someone walked up behind you and is trying to talk to you if you are listening to audio.Mic quality is just great. You will sound crisp and clear. No echos, distortion at all. Tested in best way, few others i know are using same headphone and i have heard then speak on multiple devices like the same headphone, poly sync 40+, iphone & S21 Ultra.Battery life is amazing. I charge it for an hour before my day starts and it survives for ~12 hours. I am using a PD adapter.If you use this for work only and have a travel planned. Dont worry. There is an amazing hard case which Sony provides. Quality again speaks luxe.Overall I would say, dont hesitate to sped your money on this product. While some may say there are other products at cheaper rate available. But this one gives what you pay for- Best in class- sound, anc, voice, comfort & battery life and not to forget the palatial quality of fit and finish",5,24/09/22,mixed dataset.csv,0
"Cons :1. European plug 🔌 provided. Fits loose on Indian power sockets.2. Something frames drop / freeze while playing farcry 5. But its not common. Happened to 3/100 times3. Batteries run out pretty often. Better to get good quality rechargeable batteries.4. The console doesn't connect to any Bluetooth speaker or third party controllers wirelessly. Have to rely on your display unit for that.5. I wish more big and famous titles were added to game pass.6. Limited games support mouse and keyboard. Being a Microsoft device, i'd expect it to run all the pc games with MKB support, sadly that's not the case.So FPS gamers, don't even try. Stick to PC, consoles are catching up very very very slowly.Pros :1. This thing is big power-small package deal. Casual gamers, this is your go to. I have 5-7 titles at a time always installed and this thing handles it pretty well.(Farcry 5, Batman Arkham knight, AC origins, Watchdogs 2, Ghost recon, UFC 4, power wash) and i still have 120 gigs left, imagine.2. The fit and finish is phenomenal. This console is something you'd show off. The design is top notch and attention to detail is through the roof.3. Upscales to 4k. I play on a 55 inch tv, runs everything like flagship console. No compromises4. Affordablilty to charge the controller. You can charge the controller by three different ways - batteries, usb cable, xbox's controller dock.5. Fits anywhere. I carry it around with my laptop and tablet in my 40L backpack, and i'm still left with a lot of room for my other stuff.",5,23/08/22,xbox seriesS,32
"Review after using for 15 months.Bought the series s at the time, as the series x/ps5 were not available in India, but I was worried the performance may not be up to par. After playing many AAA games courtesy of game pass, I can confirm that this is not the case. Have never faced frame drops or freezes in any games. The portability was also surprisingly good. I was able to carry the console along with cables and 2 controllers easily in a laptop backpack, and it's very light too.However, during side by side comparisons it's evident that the series x has better graphics, so if you're coming from a high end pc, the graphical performance may not be satisfactory. Another com is that with only about 360 gigs of useable storage, you can only keep very few games at a time.Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone who does not require the absolute cutting edge in graphics, and for people who require that, a pc would probably be a better option than a series X anyway.",5,09/08/22,xbox seriesS,7
"Hi I bought this Headphones after a lot of research I hope this review help you to make an informed decisionBelow is the rating for each aspect of the Headphones (5 Star rating system)Active Noise Cancellation 4.7/5Well this is industry leading ANC we are talking about once the ANC is on you cannot hear anything from outside world be it music on your phone or movies on your television or gaming sounds on your computer .Comfort 4.8/5I have worn this thing 4-5 hours at a time and it doesn't feel heavy or my ears don't hurt a bit, cushions are nice and comfy and soft.Sound Quality 4.5/5Bass is a little low but it so makes up with such a crystal sound that you hardly notice itMic 4/5Microphone is where I had a little problem it seems when there is outside noise it works like you are on a speaker so you have to speak up a little but the voice is crystal clear for the recipient even it seems like you are talking from far off.Connectivity 4.9/5Bluetooth Connectivity is just awesome it has bluetooth 5.0 connection and connects to upto 2 devices at a time, which is a perk if you have multiple devices.Touch Controls 4.8/5Touch Controls on Headphones are simply awesome they are very easy to controlApp Controls 4.7/5Sony has an app to control headphones to maintain connection and even adjust equalizer and it even tells you how are you using your headphones. its has something which they are calling 360 degree sound something like spatial audio from apple (but it works only with some apps not all of them)Battery Life 4.9/5As advertised they say headphones battery life is 30 hrs in reality i have got upto 22 hours which i think is pretty decent considering the sound quality (which is very high)Charging 4.9/5It has quick charge feature so if your ever in a hurry just charge for 5 mins and your get about hours playback time which i think its pretty neatCall quality 4.8/5This is the only thing which was making me question weather or not I want to buy these headphonesexcept from mic sound like you are on speaker the call quality is very nice and voice quality is nice too it connects to all the apps which i was afraid it might not connect to namely WhatsApp, teams, WebEx, google meet etc. it works on everything so no worry on this front as many reviews out there say they had a problem with connect their headphones to these app this is not the case for me and it worked out on first try itself.Tested on iPhone 11 pro, iPad with M!, TCL TV with fire TV Stick, Sony TV with Fire TV Stick, Computer  Android phone",4,04/08/22,mixed dataset.csv,58
"Just bought these headphones on recommendation from a friend how has M3 Model of the same. So far, I am impressed with the quality of the sound and the noise cancelling.I flew from Delhi to Montreal (16 hours flight) and then from Montreal to San Francisco (6 hours flight). The battery lasted through the flight but after another 1 hour of usage at home, I got a prompt from the headphones that battery is running low so it will probably last another couple of hours. So effectively on full charge it lasted around 25 hours with noise cancelling ON all the time. Blue tooth was Not used on the plane, it was connected to the entertainment system via an external wire. 25 hours is less than what is advertised. But if it can last through out the flight across the globe, I would say it is great!Noise cancelling was very good and very similar to QC45 Bose headphones that I used while flying to Delhi from San Francisco (somebody stole my Bose QC45 on the plane so I had to buy these Sony headphones). Like Bose, It suppresses more than 90% of the plane engine noise and with music/movie playing, you will not notice the noise of the plane at all.I felt some discomfort on my ears but then realized it was the legs of my reading glasses pressing against my ears. So if you wear glasses, you will have to adjust where you put them. Having legs right behind the ears my cause discomfort.Use of buttons is intuitive and easy. The feature where it stops the Noise cancelling when you begin to talk is cool. Also the feature where it stops the music if you take off headphones is good too. Overall, I would recommend these.",4,22/07/22,mixed dataset.csv,8
"I you want to build PC only for gaming then don't buy pc buy THIS. Its performance= 1 lakh pc build🔥.My maths while choosing between XBOX or PS5 😂?ANS - See, I am actually confused while buying this thing, it's my first time to buy a console (after 1 yr fighting with IND parents 🤣). I'm confused between xbox & ps5 then I thought ""I don't have 4k Tv, I have 1080p full HD TV"" then the real fun of PS5 is on 4k tv according to its price & also there is no offer like XBOX GAME PASS. so I thought instead of wasting 1 lakh on pc or 50k on PS5, i bought this & laptop of remaining amount for my studies(great idea😅) so I bought this. Trust me If you want to buy specially for gaming & you don't have 4k TV then buy this. You will be SATISFIED on this purchase ( Lal dil🙃)",5,18/07/22,xbox seriesS,6

     Personally I had lost touch of gaming mainly due to having below par laptops, so had to play only simulators and stuff. It's been a long time dream of owning a console. And Microsoft is just doing that - ""Power Your Dreams"" as the box says.I didn't have high expectations, because at 30K you can't own an above par gaming PC. So I thought a console would perform more or less the same. But damn, as I started playing on this tiny beast, I understood its potential. Yes, it may not be future proof, but consoles are not meant to last decades together. You can easily play all if not most of the games released until now and maybe couple more years, until Series S can't keep up with the graphic requirements of next gen games.To sum up, if you're a casual or a hardcore gamer who doesn't own a gaming pc or a beginner who want to get into the world of gaming, Series S is your best bet. If you have some extra dough, have a 4K monitor/TV and you're lucky if it's in stock, go for Series X which is more future proof.Gamertag - suhasasj010",5,24/06/22,xbox seriesS,9
"Bought this over 10 days ago. This is a brilliant little gaming box at a very affordable price. I was initially skeptical of the purchase coz it's not as powerful as the Xbox series X or PS5 but then again, this isn't targeted for 4k gaming. Honestly, I don't know a lot of people who are into 4k gaming. Most gamers would choose better frame rate over bigger resolution. And it delivers of the frame rates very well! I can easily play all the games at 60 fps with ray tracing such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Psychonauts 2. And ones without ray tracing at 120 fps! That's all anybody would need. Not 4k coz most Tv's have 4K upscaling anyway lol. And the best part, the BEST PART is I get to save soooo much money by using game pass than purchasing every single game if I had bought ps5. I downloaded over 9 games worth over 30k, the cost of this console alone, for 580 bucks lololol. I already got my money's worth out of this little gem! Trust me, If you want to casually game to relax like I do, you're better off with the Xbox than PS5 only for the fact that you can save thousands of bucks by not buying every single game. I'm insanely happy with my purchase :)",5,23/06/22,xbox seriesS,4
"This is simply an amazing SSD Drive. After reading some of the reviews here I was a bit anxious to order this product. However I went ahead and ordered it on Amazon who delivered it to me the very next day i.e. today. Within an hour of unpacking the product I put it to test. I connected it to my MacBook Pro with its C Type connector, formatted it in Mac's native APFS format and started backing up my Pictures folder having 303.39 GB of my photographs. The entire back up was finished in 10 min. 16 secs. which works out to an astounding speed of 493 MBs/Sec. The SSD in the process became very very mildly warm which could hardly be felt with my fingers. What more can one ask for from a SSD Drive meant for back up. I am extremely delighted with it and cannot recommend it enough for anyone who is considering it for back up purposes. I am ordering one more for my Windows Laptop and will update this review based on my experience with that laptop.Update on 12th June 2022:Today the second SSD Drive arrived and was tested on on my Windows laptop running Windows 11 OS. The backup of 329 GB of data took 21 mins 48 secs which works out to a speed of 252 MBs/sec which though not anywhere near the speed of 493 MBs/sec I got on my Mac is still pretty good. Also the drive just became very mildly warm which is nothing to worry about. In short my experience with the drive remains very positive.",5,10/06/22,mixed dataset.csv,3
"Delivered on time and in perfect condition.I got this primarily because building a PC that can match the capability of this little machine is impossible at the price point.Also this is my first console.Given the fanboying around the PS5 digital being closely priced to this, it wasn't available anywhere nor is it going to be anytime soon.That being said the Series S is kind of a underpowered machine which is irrelevant for me as i do not have any 4k displays/tv. There are no frame drops even in the harsh climate we have here in Mumbai at 1080p and the device can get hot.So for the people confused as to which they should go for the PS5 or the Xbox, i believe the only edge the PS has right now is the exclusive games if those are specifically the ones that you want to play. Otherwise if you don't have a 4k output, this is a no brainer.Nevertheless the list of pros and cons below.Pros:1. Easy on the pocket but still plays all latest titles. I am playing forza horizon 5, Red dead 2 (still not optimized for series s or x and plays on 30 fps) and they run without issues.2. Game pass, there is no real competitor to this service.3. Compact and silent though the corners are pointed.Cons:1. Storage: Free space is around 360 GB which is less considering the two games i have menitoned above take up 100GB each. But it is up to the user to finish games before downloading new ones rather than wanting to play 5 high end games at one time.All arguments considered storage is bit of a bummer.2. No discs: For the first time console owner this isn't a problem at all but it is a serious one for some one who own previous generations.3. Controller: the controller is good but runs pn batteries, so an arrangement may be required to get in rechargeable batteries depending on how much time you spend playing.Overall a fun and compact console which i can recommend along with the game pass. Just take care to place in a well ventilated area and ypu are good.",4,04/06/22,xbox seriesS,6
"I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.",5,22/05/22,mixed dataset.csv,437
"If you’re buying this for studying and if your main requirement is Noise Cancellation/ ANC, then do read this.I got these a month back and I had never used an ANC headphone before. I did a lot of research trying to decide between XM3 and XM4 but I ended up getting these because they did have a slight edge over the XM3.-Now. I used them for about 3-4 hours daily and my battery had lasted for 14-15 days at a stretch which is amazing.-I don’t use it for music much but I listen to a lot of educational videos and my ANC is always on.-ANC is great! Now it’s not going to completely block people noises but it’ll block out every other noise. For people talking around you, you’ll be to hear them but the volume will be low. So you can push that away and concentrate on your reading. But if you’re watch a video or something, you won’t be able to hear people around you. Hence, in my opinion, ANC is amazing. Life is so much easy.-My ears don’t hurt and I have no health issues like some people claimed. But if you experience something of that sort, return them and stop using them immediately. But I was lucky. Also, I didn’t experience any heating issues and they’re super duper comfortable.-The silver looks amazing but can get dirty. I am kinda clumsy so I got one red mark on mine like you can see in the picture but other than that, it’s all good. Keep it in the case Sony provides.Conclusion: as of now, the headphones are a boon. I don’t use them for workouts and stuff. So as a student or working human living in a noisy environment, get these!!",5,14/05/22,mixed dataset.csv,5
"This is easily the worst money I’ve ever spent for anything. There are lots of cons with this headphones and I am surprised that no one mentioned it in any of their reviews so don't be fooled by going only through the positive reviews in YouTube and here. Maybe Sony sent them a free review unit to review them or something but don't believe their overhyped reviews. The WORST headphones I've ever used and they claimed that they have 5 microphone for audio quality, it's a horse *&^%$ lie.Nothing in this headphone that can justify its 24k price, maybe I can pay 10-12K for this and be little happy with cons it offers. Music quality is good but I can get the same quality of music in other headphones that are even cheaper than this. I don’t really feel any difference in the music quality on AirPods and XM4 but AirPods 3 doesn’t have noise cancellation but  anyway it’s an obsolete feature in XM4..1. If you’re planning to buy it primarily for meetings then don’t buy this. Worst call quality on both ends and if you’re on a Mac then that will make it even worse.2. Ear cups are not comfortable at all, it’s paining after 20mins of wearing it.3. Noise cancellation is not that great as everyone hyped. I am getting headache after 10mins of having noise cancellation on. There is a hiss sound all the time when you wear it without playing anything. I can clearly hear Fan, someone speaking in background and many other outside noise. I tried the reset and switch between ambient and NC mode but doesn’t seems to be working.4. The material used on the ear cups looks very cheap and fragile so I have a strong feeling that it won’t withstand the Indian humidity for very long. So beware of it.5. Music is okayish and bass is heavy but you can adjust the EQ in the app based on your preference but overall it’s not worth the hype what every YouTubers are making. TBH airpods delivering better quality when compared to this piece of *^$*&. My recommendation is to buy Apple AirPods 3 or Pro if you’re on a Apple eco system.. Even I would recommend Bose QC 45 or 700 that works well with Apple products but don’t buy these crap and it’s really not worth the price we are paying.Other than these complaints everything else is super awesome and you will enjoy it 😉😀Update: After a week, Noise cancellation efficiency is reduced to almost 50% and I can hear more outside noise. It’s not just comfortable wearing it for a long time, I bought AirPods 3 today 14/04/22 and sound quality is more or less same but very comfortable to wear, working senselessly with my Mac and iPhone. I am using AirPods 2nd generation already so I know AirPods are best with Apple devices. I am happy now :)Luckily Amazon is generous enough to get the return, I returned this headache oops typo headphone and bought AirPods 3.",1,11/04/22,mixed dataset.csv,18
"This was delivered on the due date as promised. I hv been a PlayStation guy so far and this was my first MS console. I was skeptical knowing that there is no disk drive. But after using it for about two weeks, along with the game pass, I'm deeply satisfied. The gaming is as smooth as it gets and at a very reasonable cost. You do miss out on PlayStation exclusives like Spiderman and Uncharted and maybe few more, but the sheer choices at game pass make up for more than that.I'm a racing freak and my son is more of a combat gamer. We are both spoilt with choices and can't seem to focus on a single game. The monthly game pass i bought is valid for 8 months which is way more than I could have bargained for!!! There is a flip side though... I hv a 65"" smart tv and the pixels are at times not very clear. The game loading is at times slow. And due to the 364 GB storage you can store limited number of games. This doesn't bother me as much as my son as he likes to move from one game to another.But overall it's a great console with super smooth handling and features. No major complaints.One thing, ensure you have good internet connectivity to unleash the might of this console.",4,25/02/22,xbox seriesS,2
"This Console, though with 512GB SSD Storage out of which, 364GB Approx is Available Storage, is quite a Functional and cost Effective Console, for the Casual Gamer. Hardcore Gamers may of-course look towards the Big Brothers like PS5, and XBox Series X, but their Availability in the present Market  scenario is a Pain.Being a Casual Gamer, mostly into Racing or some Simulations, this is the Device I chose over the Big Brothers, and I Don't regret. This is an All Digital Console, One can download Games from Xbox App Directly to the Console, and with Xbox Game Pass Subscription coming at Very Nominal Prices, its even more easier to lay hands over 100s of games, First Day Launches and More!Moreover, Not Many Games are required to be installed or played at a time for a casual gamer. 1-2 games of choice are sufficient at a time, i believe.I have presently Installed Forza Horizon 5 (110GB), Halo Infinite (68GB) , Microsoft Train Sim World 2 (26GB) and Microsoft Flight Simulator Standard (This is huge and size is approx 120GB). All these installed and I still have approx 64GB left and Performance of the Console is Fast and Smooth.Loading Time for any of above games is Hardly about a Minute.Overall, a Budget friendly Gaming Console, with Next Gen Gaming Features as well as support for previous generation Games!!",5,16/02/22,xbox seriesS,2
"I have gone through a lot of reviews on various platforms before buying this product, but at some few places i observed people mentioning about the  headphones causing them 'tinnitus', but as far as i am concerned i havent observed the same in my 10 days of usage so far. I am dividing my review into the below categories followed by pros/cons.1. Design and build quality: The design on these is a decent one, the build is definitely plastic, but dont  get me wrong, they definitely feel premium, and even though thet used plastic on these, but its  definitely good quality.2. Comfort: This is by far one of the most comfortable piece of headphones i have used so far, i mean  literally wear them for 3-4 hours and you wont feel that you have it on ur head on those times.  Although i havent stretched  by wearing them for longer periods than that, but i am pretty confident,  anyone will hardly have to worry on that aspect.3. Battery: I have found the battery life to be okay on these, they advertise a 30 hr backup but i think u  can easily get 20+ hours on these, so yeah this department is fine as well but in current market i have  seen different vendors like Marshall doing a phenomenal job with the battery by providing close to  80hrs in their 'Major 4' model of headphones, so yeah if you are some one for whom battery life is of  utmost importance, i would suggest you to get something similar to the Marshall Major 4s.4. Sound-Quality: The sound quality is amazing on these, and why not, these are Sony's, we can expect  the same from them, the low are detailed, mids are well tuned, highs are balanced, the bass is good  enough, but this is subjective, i mean these are not heavy bass set of pairs, for heavy bass you may look  for something like the XB series of the Sony's. But talking about the overall quality i am compelled to  say that these are definitely a bang for your buck.5. Noice-Cancellation: I kept this topic for the last but i dont think i need to talk much on these as these  definitely nail it, these are the king of ANC as i have already heard earlier at many places. they also give  u the option to customize the level of noise cancellation. As per me they are only 2nd to noice  cancellation after the Apple airpods max, but given the price point they completely justify what they  are offering. Regarding call quality, i didnt get much time to check the call quality except a couple of  occurences but found them to be decent. However if you are specifically looking forward to call quality,  the bose 700s can be a better option for you.Pros: 1. Great amount of customization provided by the sony app. 2. Timely firmware updates for the headphones. 3. Good enough carrying case of the headphones. 4. Less weight as compared to other premium offerings in this segment. 5. Decent battery life. 6. Mesmerizing sound.Cons: 1. Lack of aptx/aptx-hd codec: At this price point atleast they should offer aptx codec. 2. Lack of water/splash resistance: Given the premium segment, they should atleast offer splash rating  to these. 3. At this premium price point they should atleast offer a couple of years of warranty like the  Skullcandy's 4. Less number of support centers for these. 5. Lack of detachable earcups.Verdict: If you are ready to shell out this premium, then these headphones are definitely a good choice for you if you are looking for an allrounder.",5,28/01/22,mixed dataset.csv,7
All consoles are good in there own way. Whatever your mind say just go for it. I pick this console because of the price range which I guess matter alot for most of people.Read before you buy.1. You are not going to get any Pc built for the high end games which you can play on xbox series s.2. All console need a game pass which cost you around 650 - 800 per month. But I got 7 month extra as offer was applied. So make sure if you can pay for pass only thenyou buy any console.3. I'm not a pro gamer so space issue is not very much deal to me. But Yes if you want to install more and more game. You definitely switch to upper Series X or PS5. Or may be you can buy the Expensive SSD.4. Many people will say go for PS5 just for games you can get on it. But Bros no one going to give you free games. You all have to spend money to buy game and I don't know which games are not available for Xbox series. I almost found every game on game pass or in the microsoft store.Verdict : Depend on your money and availability you can go for any console you just love to play game it's depends on your budget now.,5,17/01/22,xbox seriesS,7
"Disclaimer: It's just my personal opinion and the problems that I have faced, so it's not a ganeralized review, don't get triggered.Note: The only reason I bought this because PS5 is almost impossible to get in MSRP, and I just wanted to have a console and play a few specific titles.1. Game Pass: I appreciate this one, got mine for 600 rupees for 8 months for the first time and then 600 per month. You'll get over 100 games you know the whole story. Most of the games are just meh, but there are some AAA games too I found more than 15 games that I wanna play so a good deal for me, and you get a bit of discount on games as well if you want to purchase some titles specifically.2. Pricing: Simply outrageous. 300 USD is between 21000-22000 INR (Around the time I'm writing this review) and this is 35000. Even after those so called 'customs and taxes' that government eats, price is still very high. Same thing with other electronics as well.3. Performance: Been using it for over 2 weeks, no problem so far. Not going into technical analysis as there are a ton of videos about that on YouTube. Games that are only marked as 'optimized for series s' can go over 60 fps and beyond. Not all Xbox 360 games will run at 60fps. You won't have any problem with the gameplay at all.4. Backward Compatibility: Well, kinda. But mostly disappointed, one of the reason why I bought this machine is because this is backward compatible with all previous gens of Xbox, which is somewhat true, but a whole lot of games from previous gen will not be available. For example, I want to purchase Prince of Persia trilogy and other titles of the series but only Forgotten sands is available for purchase, Sands of time is listed in the store but it says 'Not available separately' others aren't even there and you won't find most of the previous gen games in the store at all, as it's a digital only console, you can't play them with the disc either.5. In-store purchases: There are some problems with that, although this point is very subjective and other people may not bother paying 50-60 rupees extra or a little more than that, as there is a wallet system in PlayStation, I can purchase a wallet top up from Amazon, say a 2000 rupees top up for exactly 2000 rupees, delivery in an hour or two, and use it to pay for the online in-store purchases. But there's no such reliable system here in Indian Xbox account, I only have to use my card to pay and the problem is, they'll charge me for the currency conversion, I end up paying a bit extra than the actual price of the game. Which is very much avoidable if they do something with a proper wallet system. Wallet top ups are not available in India, at least not for fair price, I saw websites charging 1500 rupees for a 999 top up and that's ridiculous.6. Emulation: I think this is a worth mentioning point as this console can emulate games of every other console if you don't already know, including PS1, PS2, PS3, Wii, Wii u, Gameboy and previous gen consoles from nintendo. There are videos on YouTube that you can refer if you're into this.7. Exclusive titles: That's the only problem that turns off a whole lot of people, there are really not that impressive titles as compared to the PlayStation or PC then again, personal taste. I really want to play Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon series, Last of Us series, Uncharted series, God of War and others, not to mention some really cool upcoming exclusive titles on PlayStation. But there are a few titles like RYSE son of rome, fable 2, red dead redemption (First part) that are xbox exclusives, rest is really upto your personal preferences.These are just a few things I've experienced so far, overall, I'm happy with my purchase and of course will buy a PlayStation as well in future but not leaving Xbox. I'll keep both of them.All the mentioned things are just my personal experience and some points are highly subjective, so may not be applicable or helpful for everyone, it wasn't a full fledged review, just some points for people to keep in mind before purchasing the console, if you're only concerned about the performance, you won't have any issue, it is surprisingly good, but just not for 35000 rupees, provided that the PS5 digital edition is just 5000 rupees away.",3,29/12/21,xbox seriesS,44
"There are several video reviews that enumerate the pros and cons of the Xbox Series S, so I won't go into too much detail here.There is no reason that most gamers shouldn't have the Series S as their primary console, especially in India. It's very cheap and when you throw in the Xbox Game pass, the value proposition here is ludicrous.The only two drawbacks are lack of 4K gaming and no disc support. The former is a ""first world problem"", because those that can afford 4K gaming can also usually afford scalper rates for the Series X or PS5. The latter is just stalling for time, as all digital gaming is an inevitability. Sad, but true.But the Series S is available now at market value. Snag it as soon as you can(put it on EMI like I did if you have to) and rest assured that you'll have a decent gaming setup for the next few years at least.If you must upgrade to a PS5 (for exclusives) or the Xbox Series X (for ""hardcore gaming""), do it in a couple of years when the supply hopefully exceeds demand. Till then, this little beast will not disappoint!Note: I'm a Sony Pony and this is my first forray into the Xbox ecosystem. I never would have taken the plunge if it weren't for the affordability of the Series S. Take that for what it's worth.",5,17/12/21,xbox seriesS,3
"First of all I would like to thank amazon for before time delivery...Hats off....I bought series s as series x are out of stock everywhere in india and I don't want to shill out double the MSRP to scalpers.At First i was skeptical whether this tiny machine can game properly  as this was my 1st console and I am a pc gamer mostly gaming at 1440p 60+ fps on my pc with RX 5700xt.But boy I was so wrong,the series S can basically do everything a series x can do but at 1080p.i paired it with a 4k monitor and the games look soo good....Internal 512gb ssd is small and you can only keep 2 or 3 AAA games max at a time before you run out of memory. The expansion card is pricey so I am waiting for the price to drop in future meanwhile I have connected a 4TB external hdd to it to play all previous gen games..One of of the best feature that distinguish a XBOX Series X/S from a playstion is the game pass where for a low monthly you can enjoy hundreds of game.Playstation doesn't have this  even if you subscribe to PS+ trust me I have them both.PS 5 does have some good games but they are handfull but with gamepass you virtually have all previous gen xbox game to play with game pass subscription.Series x/s optimized games can only be installed on internal ssd or Seagate expansion card but for all other games you can install on external hard drive..Console games are expensive then PC unless they are on sale so if you want to game more and pay less I will advice you to go with series s with gamepass...Happy Gaming",5,04/12/21,xbox seriesS,3
"What I love most about it is how compact it is. It just tucks away into my tv's side cabinet and looks like a showpiece item, a befitting aesthetic as the games look gorgeous.I have played Control UE and Forza Horizon 4 thus far and they look gorgeous in spite of them being 2 year old games. I have a 4k tv and while these games look great, I have noticed that a few last gen titles look bad as they run an upscaled One S version. eg. Control runs at 720p 30fps, and it looked bad enough that I bought the 1080p 60fps Ultimate Edition. I don't suppose this would be a problem going forward as games are optimized. The Control UE was gorgeous and had butter smooth gameplay.The console is also extraordinarily quiet and thereby ensures that you get really good audio.A recommendation is getting rechargeable batteries. The controllers require a lot of juice for vibration effects.",4,10/11/21,xbox seriesS,0
"The headphones are the best when it comes to noise cancellation. With the Automatic Noise Cancellation (ANC) mode, you will not here ""most"" of the natural noises like that of vehicles, rain, etc. The communications though it will block, it is not designed to fully eliminate the noise created by people which you can see in the Sony FAQ. The sound quality is great. But there is an issue. If you are using under a ceiling fan, and you switch on ANC (full noise cancellation), you will get a sensation of wind noise coming in (to describe the noise, if you are taking a video with your mobile phone while travelling in your vehicle with the windshields down facing towards to direction of the vehicle, and you play the video afterwards, you will hear the same wind noise that you feel in this headset). The only way you can eliminate it is with the help of slider in Sony Headphones app and selecting the Wind Noise Cancellation (Wind NC) option, but that is not pure noise cancellation. You will here some ambient noise in the process. On top of that, it would be difficult to set it to Wind NC when you are connected just to your laptop. (Note: There is a windows app in github which does function similar to the slider in Sony Headphones app, and although it is buggy and not supported by Sony, it does the job.) For a headphone this costly, if it can't cancel and on top of that, add some extra wind noise, it is very disheartening. Since I thought it is a defect, I replaced the product within the replacement window, but the replaced one too have the same issue. You can see hundreds of review for the same issue in the internet saying that it happens in humid climate where there is moisture and to try ""silica-gel method"" to prevent the mosture, but nothing works when you are under the ceiling fan. (Perhaps, the product was not designed keeping Indian households into consideration and our extensive use of ceiling fans which creates a wind-like effect vertically) If you need to search for the issue online, go for something like ""static crackling sound"" keyword.I had a word with Sony technician and he asked me to go visit the Service Center. I will visit there Monday and provide further updates. If I can't fix it within the return window, I will return the product since I don't see why I should patronize a much hyped, too costly product if it can provide me with noise cancellation for my WFH but with terms and conditions applied. If you are using air conditioner, and for frequent travels, this is a great product. (Can't compare with other products since that is not my job and I don't have access to those headphones)",3,16/10/21,mixed dataset.csv,4
"After months of researching into many brands such as Audio technica, Beyerdynamic, Bose, AKG, it took hell lot of time to arrive to these.Basic requirements :- Long battery life, Hi-Res wireless, ANC, Bluetooth codec compatibility(LDAC required for Hi-Res music), long listening times - not much pressure on the jaw hinge.Pros :-+ Long battery life.+ Stable Bluetooth connection. Haven't experienced any distortion while moving around wearing these and phone put in my room.+ Codec Support - SBC, AAC, LDAC. No AptX or AptXHD in this model. If you looking for those codecs you might want to look the other way.+ Superb built quality with matte finish. resists fingerprints. Hinge folds/joints feels sturdy.+ ANC is stellar, drowns out most ambient sounds but higher frequencies could seep through but it will feel like someone is speaking from a good distance from you. You can put your hand on right cup to turn on ambient mode to talk. great feature to quickly talk and return back to music.+ Sound from the mics are also clear. People have no trouble in listening to my voice while on calls both cellular and online calls.+ It has a app by the name of headphones connect, which is full of useful features such has updating firmware of your headphones, analysing ambient sound to control ANC levels. it also analyses your ear shape to adapt sound output according to your ear shape and listening frequency. The app also tells which codec you are currently connected with.+ These also support 360 deg Reality Audio from various services and also includes 3-month trial which you can activate to listening Hi-Res 360RA audio.+ You can go wired(3.5mm cable included) and listen to Hi-Res lossless music with greater quality and clarity which current Bluetooth technologies cannot do. Even wired, you can turn on ANC and headphones post-processing tech to reproduce Hi quality music.+ Has a Proximity sensor inside the left cup which can detect wearing and un-wearing of headphones to play pause music.+gesture support to play pause, rewind, skip, volume-up/down from the right cup.Cons :- No Support to all Bluetooth codecs. The company should have given all the support at this kind of price.- I'd love to buy the white edition of these but they are not available in India only :(- Still find them expensive.I would suggest before going for these for listening Lossless music via Bluetooth and even wired, make sure your phone supports LDAC codec or else Hi-Res might not work. In the wired format, please check what kind of in-built DAC your phone has which can support Hi-Res output for at least 24-Bit/48Khz. If not then you need to buy an external portable USB-C DAC to listen to Hi-Res lossless upto 32bit/192khz.Hope this Helps!! Happy Listening :-)",5,24/08/21,mixed dataset.csv,2
"The headphones are 278 usd (~20k INR) on Amazon US at the time of this review. We Indians are paying super extra premiums on the prices of imported electronics. These manufacturing companies are also not giving any crap about this issue. Sony could atleast assemble the headphones in India which would amount to a lesser burden on the consumer, rather than completely expecting the consumer to bear it.Pros:Price premium issue aside, it's a great headphone with amazing sound and mic.Extremely lightweight and easy to store and carry anywhere.Superb battery life, even with noise cancellation. Best so far in any headphones I've seen.Noise Cancellation really helps people with ADHD, who have a hard time focusing on something because of sound distractions. You can use noise cancellation without playing any music, which helps you focus a lot during work or study.ConsIf you're expecting to play PC games with your friends, while on call with them on Discord, you'll be disappointed. Because the headphones can only be in either stereo mode (music, movies and other listening stuff) or in hands on mode (for calls). So while you're on stereo mode on Windows, the mic won't work. You have to manually switch to hands on for using the mic for your calls. But if you switch to hands on, the audio quality is reduced drastically to mono, to accommodate the bandwidth of mic and call audio.Although, this is generally not really a con, but just the way that bluetooth headphones function. And also, I wouldn't recommend bluetooth headphones for gaming anyway, because of latency problems too. USB headphones are much better for you in that scenario.For an average user, I don't see any reason why they can't go ahead with this. It's awesome overall.",4,16/08/21,mixed dataset.csv,0
"My review is based on using the XM4 with,1. iPhone 12 Pro Max2. MacBook Pro late 2013.If you want an ANC Headphone which doesn’t compromise on sound quality, these are the best. Fit and comfort is very good. I have medium sized earlobes and these fit me very well. Fit and comfort might be tricky for people who have large earlobes. Comfort over longer listening is very good. These don’t get so warm with longer sessions, but they do get a bit warm which is an acceptable level for me. ANC is top notch and blocks almost all noise indoors as well as outdoors. They don’t completely block out every noise though. Sound signature is classic Sony signature but with the XM4 Sony fine tuned the sound to be more balanced than bass heavy. These still do have that brilliant bass which you expect of Sony but it doesn’t bleed into the mids. Mids are slightly recessed but still has body to the vocals and other mid frequency sounds. Highs are pretty detailed and doesn’t sound sibilant(Not ear piercing). These sounds absolutely gorgeous while watching movies/shows. No latency with videos on streaming platforms. There’s a latency while watching videos on apps that aren’t optimised for BT headphones, like reels on Instagram, etc. There is latency when playing games like pubg.Pros:1. Strong connection, no drops2. Multipoint connectivity - Can connect to 2 devices at the same time. Seamless switching between two devices. Works always.3. Excellent Sound Quality4. Kick ass ANC5. Excellent comfort, no clamping force(There might be some for people who have large head sizes)6. Easy to store with the provided hard case.7. No creaks or other noises from the moving parts.Cons:1. Battery indicator is not real time on both the phone, as well as the headphone connect app. It’ll only show for every 10% drop. (100%, 90%, 80%)2. Wired mode sounds as good as the wireless, if not a bit better only when switched on and anc is turned on. When switched off, the sound through wired mode isn’t even as good as the wireless mode.",5,15/08/21,mixed dataset.csv,0
"UPDATE:SSD Failed. Search on internet this model has a lot of issues and if you are planning to store important data it's your loss. Like in my case where very sensitive financial statements, account details were stored. I used it 4 times to backup data till now and it failed completely, the SSD Fails to be detected. Now I can get it replaced in warranty but in India a third party support store is going to examine it to ensure its not working then they will replace but more than the drive due to the sensitive nature of data I cannot hand it over to someone else other than the actual company. If they try something funny I will lose a boat load of cash. SanDisk says they will destroy defective drives in due time and not try to reuse but when is that time or can they guarantee no data leak they don't say anything. Look upon Google a small PC repair shop bought 7 of these for their engineers to carry essential stuff for their job and 6 of them failed. Many such examples are there. So buy at own risk and don't store important data or data you don't want others to see.OLD REVIEW:Its a good SSD. No Space Issues. No Speed Issues. Runs warm though. 1050MB/s model.For people complaining it takes more space than copied, its not a fault of the product its the exFAT formatting the default with which the product comes. Reformat into NTFS and everything will be fine. NTFS is better from security stand point but for disk lifespan exFAT is better. Overall I feel NTFS is better, ran multiple SSDs with it and won't really matter, you won't use this your entire life.For people complaining about speed not just the port but the cable you are using also matters. Don't use your phone cable to test it, it will come out pathetic. Use the given cable on a USB 3.2 port for max speed. USB 3 ports will be blue in color, exact standard of your computer you need to figure out.One real issue I see is it runs warm (when not doing anything) to slightly hot when using, not to the extent to freak out. If the case is warm the internal SSD should be hot. Don't know what kind of heat sinks this has, can't crack open to see. Will try to research, reach out to SanDisk and update here. SSDs do get warmer than traditional HDDs, so no need to worry a lot.Overall worth the money. Bought very recently, will update if something changes.",1,29/07/21,mixed dataset.csv,58
"Purchased 2TB Sandisk Extreme Portable 10gbps uses Samsung M.2 NVME SSD internals so will be extremely durable. I also read that this SSD has a DRAM cache to buffer the data makes it slightly better than Samsung T7 which is without a DRAM.To set the background, I recently bought the Acer Spin 5 i7 11th gen with 16gb LPDDR4X RAM, 500gb M.2 NVME PCIE Gen 4 SSD with 16gbps transfer rate. 2 Thunderbolt 4 C ports, 2 USB A ports, HDMI snd Micro SD slot. To match its capability, I purchased this Sandisc Extreme Pro 10gbps 2TB model.Could achieve real world 1+ gbps peak transfer speed over USB C Thunderbolt 4 for the Video folder. The video folder transferred in a jiffy. USB C 3 2 with 10gbps transfer capability will be sufficient to harness capability of this external Sandisk SSD.For Snaps and Music folder, speeds reduce to an average of 550mbps. Album metadata/Album cover slows the speed significantly to a crawling 10-15mbps.For Document folder, speed drops to about 475mbps.Therefore, in my thoughts for external SSD, write with maximum sequential transfer speeds is directly proportional to the file size (for small file sizes, HDD with USB 3.1 support will still be faster at peak threshold of 120 -300mbps). This is due to the quirky read-scan-erase-write cycle for each written file on SSD unlike direct sequential write on HDD over empty disc space.Also, please ensure that alternate USB C-C or USB A-C cables must be certified  for minimum 10gbps transfer speed (my Amazon Basic USB C-C charging cable could not support >30mbps as its only meant for fast charging and not fast data transfer).Three soft issues to note is-1) SSD gets hot to touch during use2) 1xUSB C-C cable provided is stubby and short. Additional USB C female to USB A adapter is provided though the connection with main cable is a bit flimsy and not firm.3) Sandisk 5 year Warranty registration website did not recognize model number-serial number combination. I had to chat with their US Customer Support, provide them photos of front, back of the drive and Amazon Invoice copy. Next day, Warranty registration email was received from Sandisk for 5 years as promised.Update:I formatted the Sandisk Extreme Pro drive to NTFS so I can back up the Win 10 Laptop System Image (if you use Apple device, NTFS cannot be used for back up so take note). My 475 gb (all partitions) were backed up as an ISO Image file in just 15 minutes flat via Thubderbolt 4 USB C port! This is the best case scenario for restore in case something goes wrong using Recovery USB stick.CAUTION: NTFS format being newer and faster is not recognized by iOS nor Android (there is a hack) so take the right decision based on usage.Conclusion:Great for speed junkies, Gamers and Content creators",5,12/07/21,mixed dataset.csv,94
"Update: Thu/01/July/2021The replacement arrived, and performed exactly as the earlier device - poor microphone performance. Hence asked Amazon to return the headset, and it is now scheduled to be picked up.Tue/29/June/2021Okay, it's only Day 3 of this headset for me but I have asked for a replacement. It will arrive tomorrow, I hope it is better.I was using a 15 months old JBL 650BTC, and had a client escalate about background noise on my calls (intesntivie in his WFH ways of working from the client, but what can I say) and hence was forced to upgrade to something better. In a fit of rage, I looked at the best rated headphones and decided to pick up the XM4 over XM3 which was available for INR 8000 less, assuming that this would be an huge improvement. Yep, I made that mistake of buying in a hush.The order arrived as promised, however the Amazon bill was inside the product box, instead of inside the AMAZON packaging. I didn't think of it much at that time because I wanted to try this headset real quick. But before I provide my larger experience / review, I want to address the elephant in the this review section:IT HAS THE WORSE MICROPHONE PERFORMANCE THAN JBL 650BTC THAT I BOUGHT FOR INR 9,999There, I said it. It really is so worse. There is a huge wind noise if a fan is running even at 50% capacity which is discomforting to the other person on the call. Any background noises are not even muffled. Even when I reported an issue with this headset, the Amazon Tech specialist could clearly feel the discomfort from the moment I switched to XM4 headphones on my phone. When I disconnected from XM4 and used my iPhone, that does a much much better job at cancelling background noise - and in his words ""Oh such a relief, suddenly your voice has become sweeter"".My need:A very good headphones which cancels out noise around my background (kids playing or running around at times) for my work related calls on Teams/Skype/Zoom.Setting up:It was easy to connect the headset to my phone and laptop and it was a rather straight forward process. The Sony Headphones software is very quirky and definitely not the best out there (on iOS device). UX is real bad and it is confusing for the first time users. Took a while to get my head around setting it up. It will take a while getting used to it.Battery Life:The 30 hour battery life being claimed, has so far lived up to it. In the three days, I have used it for about 20 hours, and after charging for the first time, about 40% of battery still available. With usage this would come down as battery life goes, however this is promising.Music and Sound QualityTwo stars only because listening to music is fantastic, and it is something that I cherish about this product. That said, for audiophiles, this may be a good/better/best alternative to other phones depending on their choice of music and preferences. I enjoyed listening to the music on this device, the ANC for listen works perhaps the best I have tried (I have tried the BOSE QC35 as well) and can attest that it does a super job of silencing the outside noise for you. Perhaps the best at that, I would argue.This does not solve my problem though. I need this headset primarily for calls, and secondly for music. For a headphone this expensive, the superb microphone performance is the least you would expect! Rather, it is just a given it should and XM4 fails terribly at that.",2,29/06/21,mixed dataset.csv,3
"This item was in my wishlist for quite sometime, I finally bought it and felt cheated as soon as I opened the package, I received an already unboxed item, which was definitely used before as can be ascertained by the dust on the inside of the ear cups, I requested for a replacement and amazon was really helpful.I received a new device two days later, it's a brand new one with proper packing and I was excited to use this.  I primarily wanted it for my office calls and listen to some songs now and then.The main problem with this headset is the software, the sony connect app helps you toggle between various ambient modes, noise cancelling was the most hyped feature in this headset, and it works average at best, I can still hear the rumbling of fan, although subdued, it's not completely gone.Disappointed with the noise cancelling, I chose to keep it turned off for the time being, but there is no way to persist that, when ever you turn on the headset, it defaults to noise cancelling mode, that is Ok, but trying to turn it off is again is a bit confusing, you have to turn off multiple options in the sony app to turn off the noise cancelling.Coming to the audio part, honestly speaking I don't know what highs and lows are, I'm just interested about my experience, and I expected this headset to wow me, but it didn't. It was quite average, I tried fiddling with the various Equalizer settings, but nothing worked, you may think I was looking for Bass, but quite the opposite actually, I prefer the slower paced songs, but didn't find the clarity that I was expecting. I even noticed a crackling sound when playing songs.Coming to the office calls part, I took a few calls with this, the call quality was good, except for once when I heard a periodic buzzing sound, I checked with the other person if there is some noise on his side, he told me there is none, not even a fan.Major selling point of this device for me was the multi device support, I bought it just so that I can take calls both on my phone and laptop. This turned out to be another disappointment, while I was able to connect to 2 devices, the audio is completely lost if there was any sound from the second device, while audio from the first is playing, notification beeps on either device stopped sound from both devices, you have to restart the headset for it work again, this was the breaking point for me.It is comfortable to wear and has quite a premium feel, the build quality is really good. I would have been happy to keep using it if the software was any good, I feel the sony headphone connect app makes it quite difficult to use.May be go for it, if you plan to use it on a single device and not worried too much about audio quality.I have read lot of reviews on this, It has been the most favoured headset of MKBHD and many famous tech reviewers, I'm disappointed it didn't meet my expectations.",3,25/06/21,mixed dataset.csv,4
"There are enough reviews on the web space on this product. I agree with all. These are possibly the world's best NC phones today, feature-rich and top-notch quality. I would like to mention real-world use. I will mention some niggles and drawbacks that you may or may not face:- The first issue is with the Bluetooth (BT) connection. BT, as everyone knows, has never been perfected. First time pairing is quick enough but if for some reason the pairing drops, it is not easy to reset. Please do note that I am a VERY TECH-SAVVY person. I purchased this for my uncle who is an elderly person and he faced the issue.- The controls (Volume +/-, Track +/-) are on the right ear cup. Place the finger around the middle of the left cup and move it up/down for volume and front/rear for tracks. It is not intuitive to an elderly person. I think it works for me but ... Buttons are good for elderly person but they can be too small and buttons are mechanical, prone to damage. Point is know your age and limitations.- The headphones can pair with two sources and can switch between the two. For example, one source could be the TV or Music system, the other could be the phone. The switching is not easy or automatic. For example, I may be connected to music system and while thus engrossed, if I receive a telephone call, I would like the headphones to switch to phone automatically and let me hear/speak on the call. I know that this is a feature. I have not been able to figure this out but it is early days.- The Sony Heaphone Connect app is nearly an absolute requirement and it has niggles.But overall, it is a great piece of engineering.One question often pops up Sony WH-100XM4 or or Bose NC-700 or Bose QC-35I would say between the three, purely based on sound quality, it is a toss of the coin, the Sony wins on features whereas the Bose phones are much more comfortable over the ears (I have QC-25 and QC-35 is nearly an identical sibling with wireless BT. NC is at par on XM4 and QC-35. I don't have the NC-700. Sony and QC-35 have better battery life.",4,16/06/21,mixed dataset.csv,0
"Edit- June 2022Still loving it!Bought - March 2021Review Date - June 2021.Context - I have 1080p 60Hz displays at my place. I don't play games like CS:GO, Valorant, etc. (you can plug in a keyboard mouse and play those too) I enjoy RPGs (GTA V, Tomb Raider, Yakuza, etc.) and sports games like FIFA.Superb Machine, it's super compact and dead silent. Fits in one corner of my desk and doesn't look loud or absurd. Like I explained to me, it's all about constant 60 fps and RPG games, some indie games too.My biggest motivation to get this console over the others was GamePass and pricing. I believe as of 2021 it is impossible to get a decent gaming set-up at 40k or even 70k for that matter due to silicon shortages and of course the pandemic. So when Next-gen dropped I knew I had to get the Series S, it perfectly suits my requirement.The biggest concern people have is storage and let me tell you it's COMPLETELY manageable. At the moment I have FIFA21, GTA V, a couple of indie games, and another 100 GB free space I can fit probably 2-3 games in that space and at a time I would mostly be playing 2-3 games. Like score, some goals on FIFA21 then jump over to GTA V do some missions, then later chill with some indie games all while listening to songs on the integrated Spotify app and just vibing bois it is great!If you are like me, a gamer who just wants to enjoy games after work or over the weekends or even play some COD with the boys this console is for you. If you really think you need the Series X then go for it.",5,14/06/21,xbox seriesS,11
"This is a great product of you are new to console gaming and want to explore multiple games at low cost and don't care about 4K resolution that much. Don't go by the size, this console is next to the beast when it comes to performance. You get all the new gen features like high speed storage, ultra fast loading speeds, quick resume and high FPS. The heat management on this device is done very well and on par with the series X and PS5, It is impossible to hear any sound from the console even if you are playing multiple games. The loading time for games is similar to series X and PS5, and with quick resume feature you will hardly have to wait for games to load anymore.Microsoft is pushing hard for the all access to the gaming world with their game pass services, you get to explore multiple games at a monthly rate and don't have to worry about shelling out thousands on games.The most optimal way of enjoying this console is on a 1440p Monitor with 120Hz + refresh rate and HDR support. If you don't have a 4K TV then it will be very foolish to spend money on buying PS5 or series X.Most games can't achieve 1440p resolution even though microsoft says this console targets 1440p, you will be able to play most of the games at 1080p only at the moment. This might change in the future with more developer support for the console. Microsoft is incentivising the game developers to optimise their games for Series S.If you are okay with compromising on resolution then this is a no brainer buy for anyone who wants to get a next gen console without spending 50k.",5,14/05/21,xbox seriesS,2
"What I love:1. Game loading speed: The SSD makes everything super fast, even the switching time from one game to another - ""instant resume feature"" !2. Form factor: I'm amazed by its overall size, compact, easy to take anywhere you go in a backpack, especially while traveling and the minimalistic black and white look is a bonus. This is a silent machine as well !3. Game Pass: Day one itself, you already have 100+ games if you subscribe at ₹489 (console) or ₹699 (console + Gold membership + all EA Play games). No more buying physical game DVDs which are hell slow.4. Integration: The Xbox app is a gem ! You can play on a phone or a tab, wireless, where all the game processing happens on console. Phone can be used as a controller as well. I also have been completely into the Microsoft ecosystem and the apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, YouTube, OneDrive, Media Player, Apple TV etc are great add onsWhat I Don't Love:1. Actually, nothing !Have been playing for a month now and honestly haven't faced any issues till now.Only downside is the storage capacity, with only 512 GB, you can have max 6-10 games installed, but you always can uninstall and re install games quickly based on what you are currently playing. So that helps !This console is a bit costly in India, but this is a next gen console for next 4-5 years and works with all upcoming games as well ! So going for a cheaper PlayStation 4 Pro or slim keeps you restricted to older game only ! PlayStation would be a bad choice now.",5,26/04/21,xbox seriesS,5
"So here is the deal. Graphical wise almost all features such as ambient occulsion, ray tracing, vilumetric lighting.. its all there the only thing is the console outputs to 1080p max while in 60fps, which in my opinion is not very noticeable as once you get “into the zone” you will barely notice it.No performance issues or bugs or crashes in the entire period of 2 months, quick resume works like a charm and is a game changer, seriously forget about the graphics, quick resume will save you so so so much time in life that you’ll be able to play tons of games.STORAGE: so if you say 364gb is less in 2021 yes you are correct its less, but games on series s do not use 4k textures thus most of the game’s size is a bit less than their series x/ ps5 versions. Also in my experience I found storage to be sufficient as any normal gamer would only play 2-3 AAA titles at once (dont tell me you’re gonna play Gears, Halo5 and destiny all together everyday) you can easily keep like 2 AAA games and around 5-6 more indie games or previous GEN games.See in my opinion this is one of the best deals if you wanna experience Next Gen at low price, although i will say one thing, the graphical output is not as good as a PS5 but you’ll notice that only when youre running both consoles side by side on 2 TVs or else its mot much of a difference.(Also getting the game pass will literally save you thousands of dollars and you wont need to purvhase another game for next 6 months)",5,14/02/21,xbox seriesS,0
"Its been a month since i've been using Xbox series S. Not gonna list pros and cons of it. Im just gonna give my opinion on why i think its worth every penny.1. Cheapest next gen experience without any compromise. PS: i dont consider 4k 120fps a compromise coz i dont need those to enjoy a game.2. Design: its compact and simple yet very elegant. Can be fit anywhere. Pretty dense as well.3. Connectivity: Connects with anything seemlessly. Although, i'd recommend ethernet for initial setup.4. Game Pass: Game pass has literally 100s of all kinda games to enjoy. Initially it costs 59rs for 3 months and 700 after that which i think is decent considering how expensive games actually are.5. Performance: Initially, i was using it on full hd tv and after 20 days of usage i moved to 4K tv. And on both tvs, it works like it can take anything in its stride. Not even high graphic games like cyberpunk or Gears 5 or Far Cry 5.6. Cost of Ownership: The final cost of ownership is very less than any next gen consoles out there which is big plus obviously.7. Game Offers: I have seen frequent offers on games on the xbox store. I bought GTA 5 with mods for 800rs only and metro exodus series for only 500 etc.8. Recommendations: if you plan to buy it and get game pass, please do try the XS optimized games for next gen feel.9. Vision of Microsoft: Microsoft and Sony have very different vision for gaming in future. And Microsoft wants everyone to be involved in the gaming ecosystem and make it affordable and cloud enabled. I support the vision.Conclusion: if you are a casual gamer who plays it after working hours or on weekends, this should be atleast be in your consideration.",5,13/02/21,xbox seriesS,6
"The Xbox Series S is a compact next gen console. Here is few things to consider before you buy. Have you moved to disc free gaming? Do you have a 4K TV? Or do you like to play games at a solid 1080p / 1440p 60 fps? Personally I'll choose the later. The Series S does exactly that. The storage might be a downside but coming from an OG Xbox one, this definitely an upgrade. Now it's up to the developers to make games that are optimized for the series S and am sure that will present a few challenges down the line.Played Cyberpunk 2077 about an hour or so and it runs at a constant 1080p 30 FPS ( I have a 1080p 60Hz Monitor) The game is not optimized yet for Series X or S but when it will, it'll be gorgeous. The load times and the quick resume are great features to have. The custom RDNA2 architecture more than makes up for the Jaguar core of the Xbox One systems.The console is evenly priced allthough a price of 30k would have been ideal. But hey you cant get ray tracing in a 30 k PC build. So that more than makes up for itself. So would you regret buying one? Well depends on your playstyle. For me moving from an OG Xbox One to this is surely an upgrade.",4,16/01/21,xbox seriesS,2
"I think Microsoft has nailed it with the affordable offering of their next gen console. This compact little thing is a BEAST of a performer to say the least. For someone coming from a PS4 console, I just loved the blazing fast performance it offers compared to the Price and Specs it hasAfter nearly 100 Hrs of gaming on this white beauty here's my honest take on it:PROS:1) Price ( For the same performance out of a PC, be ready to shell out atleast 70 to 80K)2) Super Fast SSD.3) QUick resume function is a blessing really.4) With Game pass, You get access to a library of games so vast that you can never play it all.5) Ray Tracing........It blows my mind as to how this thing supports ray tracing with such humble specs. But it does and how. The graphics look absolutely stunning even on a 4k TV despite the fact that It supports a native resolution of only 1440P.6) The most portable gaming console ever. You can literally carry it in ur luggage wherever you go. which is exactly what m planning to do.7) Supports external HDD (USB 3.0 type) to overcome space restrictions on it's internal SSD. And infact Older generation games like Battlefield 4, Moto GP 20, PUBG etc can actually be played directly from the HDD without transferring it to the Internal storage....AWESOMEEE..8) Whisper quiet and cool : even after 4 hours straight of intense gaming, you cannot hear the fan working even in a sound proof room. It's that silent. And the Heat management is some sort of magic trick...It was barely warm to touch.9) Like previous generation XBOX, this one supports keyboard and mouse set ups for a limited few games.10) If you have a 1080p HD TV ...just close ur eyes and go for it rather than spending a bomb on more powerful consoles. And even for those with 4K TV...Trust me...at 10 feet away, your eyes cannot tell the difference between 1440P and 4K. moreover none of the TVs commonly available in the market today support more than 60hz refresh rate which means you'll never actually be able to explore the 120FPS capability of even this console, let alone the higher spec ones.CONS:1) The 500 GB SSD with just about 364 GB of available space ( For those who don't wanna read point no 7 above :)...)2) The controller isn't as exciting as the Dualsense controller of PS5 or even dual shock of PS4.3) No inbuilt battery in the controller. ( I simply ordered panasonic eneloop rechargeable batteries..problem solved)4) Might not suite you if you love to have a game disk collection.5) Doesn't support HDR or HDR 10+ on 1080P TVs. ( Not a deal breaker)I realized i had to really think hard for those CONS ....that's how good this machine is. If you are someone looking to step into the amazing world of console gaming and don't wanna spend a bomb. Just go for it'",5,14/01/21,xbox seriesS,70
"The Sony WH1000 M4s I ordered arrived within 24 hours of ordering. The fabric-feel hard case has an excellent texture and great protection, but feels lighter/flimsier than other cases for headsets this size.  Unfolding the double hinge of the headset felt awkward to open, and although solidly built, again just feels too light . The materials used for padding and casing are robust and again, excellent texture. Also, happy to report the sound quality and noise cancellation features are better than advertised, and the sound quality for both FLAC audio and conference calls are great for casual listening, and they really are comfortable for long use. That's about all that I can say positively about these headphones.Have had a few issues with the mic, and this is where the trouble begins. The software support for Android is weak, especially compared to Bose and Google products which I currently use in this category. Bluetooth connectivity is questionable on Windows and Android, and I had trouble connecting on both my laptop and mobile, which even connect easily to generic electronic products. Once connected, the mic alone disconnected midway through calls. It was awkward and I felt let down by the product. Mic support is a basic feature and frankly has been overlooked. While the mic is high quality, it chooses to turn on and off at will, and the support for the microphone does not exist on Android. The only feature that exists is something called 'speech to text' , which leaves the mic permanently on, drains the battery and offers no immediate benefit beyond knowing that someone is collecting your data. Google assistant can be set up by programming it to the 'Custom' button, but this stops the audio and hangs functionality on the headset and the phone.The battery life is also significantly lower than advertised. The multipoint connectivity which the phone boasts will drain the battery in record time, and Bluetooth connectivity does not work well anyway, as explained above. Further, recharging is awkward with the short computer USB A->C connector provided, and takes a while to charge.I am stuck with these headphones, but honestly disappointed. I was expecting a much better product given the legacy of the SONY brand. I have better sound now, but am still stuck with all the same software compatibility issues as a generic electronics product.These headphones offer excellent sound quality, but do not deserve the high price tag or premium branding.",3,01/01/21,mixed dataset.csv,3
"The Xbox Series S is the smallest Xbox Microsoft has ever created. It’s also the Xbox with the biggest questions hanging over it. Microsoft surprised everyone with this smaller, cheaper next-gen Xbox, promising that the Series S is “designed to play games at 1440p at 60 frames per second.” At ₹35K, the Xbox Series S looks, on paper, like a budget entry into the next generation of Xbox games. But the reality is a little more complicated.  The Series S shares most of the same internal components as the larger Series X. That means you get load time improvements, games that run smoother, and the promise of up to 120fps in certain titles. The big difference is the GPU power involved, which, in reality, means most people will need to pair this tiny Xbox with a 1080p TV or monitor. This is a console for those who don’t care about 4K, but questions over its capabilities still remain for me. Will this console hold back next-gen games? Will it do ray tracing well? Will it hit 1440p?  The Xbox Series S is a small console with big potential and a whole lot of questions left unanswered for now./* PROS */-Compact Design-Performance-Quick Resume /* CONS */-Limited Storage-Mostly 1080p-Not many launch games+HARDWARE+  When we first unboxed the Xbox Series S, we was shocked at the size. It’s really tiny, and we4 adore the robotic white design. The Xbox Series S is just 275mm (10.8 inches) tall, 151mm (5.9 inches) deep, and 63.5mm (2.5 inches) wide in a vertical position. Microsoft has placed rubber feet in both vertical and horizontal positions, and there are plenty of vents for cooling. Unlike the larger Series X, we think the Xbox Series S looks great in both orientations. It can also fit comfortably into my TV stand, and it feels like it has been designed to fit a normal person’s living room, rather than taking it over like the PS5 and Xbox Series X do.  At the rear, there are two USB ports, an Ethernet port, a storage expansion slot, and HDMI 2.1 out. Microsoft has added Braille bumps next to the rear ports here, which is a great move for accessibility. At the front, there’s a single USB port and no disc drive. That’s the first big difference on the Xbox Series S besides just size: you won’t be able to use any Xbox game discs you already own. You’ll need to own digital versions of games and continue to buy games through Microsoft’s digital store.  Sadly, the Xbox Series S doesn’t support Wi-Fi 6, and there are no USB-C ports. That’s a shame for future-proofing, but we think most people will miss the disc drive here more than improvements to Wi-Fi and USB ports.  The most attention-grabbing feature of the Xbox Series S design is the speaker-like black circle at the top. It’s the main fan for the Series S, and it’s where heat exhausts out of the console. we’ve only ever heard a gentle hum from the Series S, and we’ve never heard the fans really kick in during gameplay.  In terms of heat, I’d say the Xbox Series S exhausts warmer air than the larger Series X. It’s not to the point where it’s too hot to touch, but we wouldn’t want to enclose this deep inside a TV stand where airflow is restricted.  The other piece of hardware that comes in the box with the Series S is an updated white controller. It’s very similar to the Xbox One version, with an updated D-pad, textured grips, and the addition of a new share button and a USB-C port. The share button lets you quickly share clips or screenshots with friends, much like on a PS4, while you’ll need to purchase a rechargeable play-and-charge kit separately if you want to take advantage of USB-C — the controller runs on AA batteries by default.=GAMES=  Much like the larger Xbox Series X, the Series S includes a more powerful CPU and SSD storage. Both of these hardware improvements combine with 4 teraflops of GPU performance to improve existing games. This results in dramatic improvements to load times for most games. Destiny 2, which has not yet been optimized for this console, loads in just 39 seconds on the Series S. Optimized games like Sea of Thieves load in 20 seconds, and Forza Horizon 4 takes 42 seconds to get into racing.  We’ve noticed similar improvements to existing games on the Series S that we’ve seen on the Series X. Games that are currently locked to 30fps will mostly maintain these frame rates more reliably than an Xbox One S. Destiny 2 hasn’t been optimized for the Series S yet, but it feels smoother and menus are more responsive.  We’ve also tried a variety of optimized Xbox Series S games, including Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4. Both hit 60fps at 1080p on the Series S, and not the 1440p target that Microsoft promised for this console. Sea of Thieves feels like I’m playing on a PC at times, thanks to the smooth gameplay. Forza Horizon 4 also feels much smoother than what we’ve experienced on the Xbox One S version of the game running at 30fps.  Unfortunately, most games will run as if they were Xbox One S games and won’t benefit from the enhancements Microsoft made with the Xbox One X. That’s mostly because the Series S isn’t targeting 4K, and most of the One X enhancements were geared toward 4K resolution and HDR.That means, a lot of the time, the Xbox Series S still feels like an Xbox One S. Titles that use dynamic resolution scaling will also benefit from hitting the max resolution target more often, but without testing the thousands of games available, it’s hard to pick out big changes here. The changes we noticed the most came from the optimized games we’ve been testing, and they provide a glimpse at what’s possible on the Xbox Series S.  Gears 5 and Dirt 5 also demonstrate the ability for the Series S to deliver smooth 120fps gaming. The versus multiplayer mode of Gears 5 runs at 120fps on the Series S, and it feels far smoother than what’s available on the Xbox One S right now. Dirt 5 also runs in a 120fps mode, reducing the input latency when you’re cornering with the various cars in the game.  These optimized games and 120Hz modes really demonstrate the potential for the Xbox Series S, but if you’re planning to pair the Series S with a 1440p or 1080p high refresh monitor, we would check to make sure it supports 120Hz over the HDMI port. My own 1440p monitor runs at 165Hz via DisplayPort, but over HDMI, it’s limited to just 60Hz. Most modern monitors should include HDMI 2.0, but a lot of high refresh rate gaming monitors have shipped in recent years without HDMI 2.0 support.  While the Xbox Series S isn’t designed to be a 4K console, we’ve spent a lot of time using it on a 4K TV. Some titles like Destiny 2 don’t look that great automatically upscaled to a 4K TV, but others, like Watch Dogs: Legion, looked good to me. we imagine my OLED display helps mask a lot of the resolution imperfections in Watch Dogs: Legion though, as the game is set in London where it’s regularly dark and raining.  we should note here that while we was testing Watch Dogs: Legion on the Xbox Series S, Microsoft disabled the game midway through the review period. Before that, Watch Dogs: Legion had managed to totally lock up my console, turning it off entirely once. It also crashed frequently while we was playing it. we reported these issues, and it turns out, this version of Watch Dogs: Legion will include an optimized patch for Series S at launch. The version we had been testing “is not representative of the experience players will have on Xbox Series X|S,” Microsoft says.  we wasn’t able to replicate any similar crashes or issues with other games we tested on the Xbox Series S, so it looks like this was limited to this build of Watch Dogs: Legion. Given the game has been crashing Xbox One X consoles and PCs, it clearly has larger stability issues.  Just like the Series X, there’s a trend emerging for next-gen Xbox games that offer much more choice and flexibility. Dirt 5, Gears 5, and Yakuza: Like a Dragon all offer a choice between higher frame rates or visual quality. I’m hoping this trend continues across both the Series X and Series S.  One trend with the Xbox Series S we’ve also spotted is that most optimized games appear to be targeting 1080p at 60fps instead of 1440p at 60fps. Microsoft made a big deal about this being a 1440p console, but Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4, Fortnite, Watch Dogs: Legion, and For Honor will all run at 1080p instead. Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Gears Tactics are exceptions to what looks like the normal, but Yakuza only hits 1440p at 30fps.  I’d like to imagine developers are simply targeting 1080p, as that’s what most people will be using the Xbox Series S for, and it’s a relatively easy lift. I’m surprised that Microsoft’s own first-party games like Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 4 aren’t hitting 1440p, though. I’m hoping I’ll be proved wrong, and we’ll see lots of 1440p games for the Xbox Series S in the coming months, but we have a feeling this is very much going to be a 1080p console.=STORAGE & SOFTWARE=  Two of the biggest benefits of the Xbox Series S over the existing Xbox One are storage and a new Quick Resume feature. SSD storage boosts load times and performance, and I’m really glad Microsoft picked this for the cheaper Series S. While it’s great to have the fast speeds, we don’t think there’s enough storage space on the Series S for most people.  You only get 364GB of usable storage on the Series S. We have six games installed on the Series S, and it’s almost full. Call of Duty: Warzone and Destiny 2 take up over 100GB each, leaving little space for more games. Even if we estimate that the average AAA game is around 50GB, that’s still only seven games in total.  Microsoft has promised that Xbox Series S game install sizes will be around 30 percent smaller than the Series X, but we’ve noticed Gears 5 is 76.4GB on both the Series S and Series X. We hope games do get a lot smaller, but for now, the storage will be a problem for many. You can offload games to USB storage and then switch them back to the internal storage when you want to play them, but most would benefit from the expandable storage here.  The only option to expand the Xbox Series S storage is a 1TB expansion card priced at around ₹17K. That’s nearly three-quarters of the price of the console itself; combined, it’s nearly ₹52K for the Series S and additional storage. That’s more than the ₹50K price of the Xbox Series X, which comes with twice as much built-in storage. Microsoft needs to either release an Xbox Series S with 1TB of storage or introduce more sizes of expandable storage for this console. Either of these options, including buying USB storage, will cost you more money, though.  If you do manage to fill up the Xbox Series S with plenty of games, you’ll be able to quickly switch between them, thanks to Quick Resume. It suspends games and saves them to disk after you switch to another title, meaning you can switch back and, 10 seconds later, your game is ready to play.  We think this is the best new feature across the Xbox Series S and X, and when it works, it works really well. Unfortunately, not all games support it. GTA V, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4, and many others don’t support Quick Resume. Microsoft is still working to enable Quick Resume on a number of games due to a “recently discovered platform bug,” so updates should arrive after launch. While most games should support Quick Resume, it’s still not clear which missing ones will get updated.  We also ran into an issue with Quick Resume on Gears 5 during my final day of testing where it failed to load the game and presented a “something went wrong” error. After launching the game again, twice, it finally loaded properly without my Quick Resume point. We ran into issues like these frequently with the Xbox Series X preview unit, but this is the only time we’ve experienced the software problem on a retail unit.  Speaking of software, the Series S also includes the same dashboard as the Series X. If you’re an Xbox One user, it looks identical, as Microsoft has kept the same interface and features here. It definitely feels like it performs faster, and we think the general improvements that have been made to the Xbox dashboard in recent months have helped here.  We still find the Xbox guide cumbersome to use sometimes, though. Microsoft could do with offering more customization options here and simplifying the interface further. I’d also like to see the sharing of clips greatly improved. The Xbox Series S has a new share button, but it still takes far too long for clips and screenshots to be uploaded to Microsoft’s Xbox Live service for you to share them.  This is a problem that exists on the Xbox One, and we’ve had to wait minutes for clips to be available, despite having a fast 1Gbps upload at home. On my gaming PC, we can instantly stream clips or my screen to friends on Discord, and the Xbox process feels old and slow in comparison. =POTENTIAL=  I’m a big fan of this Xbox Series S design, and the console delivers a great value for ₹35K. If you own an original Xbox One, you’ll immediately see the benefits of load times, faster frame rates, and generally smoother gameplay in most games.  Much like the Xbox Series X, it feels like upgrading a PC if you move from an Xbox One. All accessories work, as do games, and many will run even better than before. This will be a significant upgrade for many games, but don’t expect to buy the Series S for the latest and greatest graphics.  This is absolutely a 1080p console, right now. I’m puzzled why Microsoft said the Series S is “designed to play games at 1440p at 60 frames per second.” That might be true in the future, but right now, some of its own studios have chosen to optimize and target 1080p, and lots of third-party developers are doing the same for Series S games.  A 1440p target would deliver crisper imagery at 1080p and even far better upscaling to 4K if you really wanted to push the Series S. There’s clearly potential for the Series S to deliver 1440p, as Gears Tactics shows. But given the vast majority of Series S owners won’t even use a 1440p display, we can sort of understand the 1080p choices being made. I’m just hoping games for the Series S move more toward 1440p, and not the sub 1080p direction.#VERDICT#  It feels like the Series S has a lot of potential but not enough games to fully realize what this smaller Xbox can do. I’m hoping to see more games offer 120fps modes on the Series S, choices for graphical settings, and ray tracing. There’s a lot of promise here, but it feels too early to say exactly how the Series S will perform in this next generation.  The storage situation will also make this a difficult purchase for some and steer others toward the Series X or even the ₹40K digital PS5. But the Series S feels like the ideal console for Xbox Game Pass, until xCloud is really a thing people can use reliably on their TVs.  The Xbox Series S is full of unknowns right now. The use case for this console isn’t as obvious as some might think. It’s not necessarily the best budget option, thanks to the storage situation. Yet, it looks ideal for a bedroom TV, for Xbox Game Pass, or as a Fortnite console. If you can deal with the storage and you’re only playing on a 1080p TV, then this should make Xbox games shine like never before. I’m just not sure what else it will deliver for the next generation of games we’re all excited about.",4,23/11/20,xbox seriesS,111
"I have been using mine for 10 daysSo my setup :Video : 3 screens (old Samsung 720p TV, Sony Bravia 34 inch 1080p tv and a Samsung monitor 21 inch 1080p)Audio : Sony MDR XB 450 APGames tested : Forza Horizon 4, Doom Eternal, Halo MCC, The Touryst, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Borderlands 3, Crysis 3, Black, Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, Tetris Effect and No Man's SkySo Series S has been touted as a budget gamer setup. Let me break down the ""budget"" bit hereConsole : 34k with discount in my caseDisplay : 1080p monitor 8kSo one time cost = 42k (not exactly budget, but gaming ain't cheap and I can assure you that at this point in time a PC giving a similar performance will not be possible to make for 42k INR in India at least, not the phrase at this point in time please)Recurring expenses :Xbox Gamepass Ultimate = 824/ month (gives you access to over 300 games on both PC and console including likes of Halo, Forza Horizon, Gears of War) annualizing to around 9900. NOTE : You can choose not to opt for this but Iam telling you, this is the best deal in gaming period.Fibre Internet : JioFiber annual is 8400 per year for 100 MbpsSo recurring expenses = 18300/ yearPlus there will be expenses related to non gamepass games you buy (all Ubisoft titles for example)If and only if these numbers sound feasible to you, even consider the Series S, you want no compromise and exclusives ? PS5 Digital or Disc and the Series X should be your choiceNow coming to the system itself, you have seen how tiny and portable it is. Is it powerful ? Oh yes ! Any game optimized for Series S|X runs 1080p 60 fps without a hitch. After many years of tweaking around with .ini files, the ability to just download and play is a huge relief.Also its fast, I don't sit on my console for longer than 1.5 hours a day . The system can resume from where you left off (even after switching off and then on, although this is not yet flawless) which further encourages a more play leave resume style, perfect for people like me. Also the loading times are frankly insane, levels in Doom Eternal for example load in around 8 to 15 seconds. Additionally as it basically runs a tweaked version of Windows you can run a browser (Edge) and other apps (Netflix, Amazon Prime) as well. So its a compact entertainment system.One major shortcoming is the frankly anemic storage on board at 364 GB (yikes), my suggestion is to get a external SSD or USB 3.1 hard drive to use as a pack mule for games. I have done the sameOverall in the first week of usage, no major crashes, quick resume is still not flawless but awesome when it works and a smooth gaming experience for all the money stated above.Hope this helps you guys !",4,23/11/20,xbox seriesS,39

     Hi to all the non verified purchase members, rather than leaving negative reviews get a console first...To verified purchase members/new buyers:The console is small and cute...and woow it rocks when you play!pros:1-SSD seriously fast as hell...loading times are under a minute for froza horizon 4 ultimate edition it jst launches with in seconds2-small and compactable...seriously its easy to carry if you re planning to move around often3-upscale to 4k/120fps and 1440p...jst wooww...i played it on Sony 4k TV and Samsung full HD TV...it clearly upscales on 4k and for a gamer like me 1080 TV its self a woow experience4-compare to ps5 - good and reasonable comparison bcoz of its price...i bought this for 32k and FH4 ultimate edition for 2.7k and tekken 7 for 630/- everythng is on sale so it depends on how you play games...if you often play much games and affordable to pay 700/-month you can choose xbox or 2999/-per year you can take ps5...ps5 has plenty of exclusives but I chose xbox over ps bcoz of FH series...well it dependsCons:1-well price segment but it's loading time is worth gng for it but tax is too much but xbox can't do anythng for that...2-ssd...512GB and 364GB usable...FH4 Ultimate edition itself requires 97+GB I don't know how will I manage for next gen games...3-Hdd is supported, actually its positive bcoz ps5 haven't revelied abt the expansion...if you have next gen games you can't keep in hdd and play it...you have to move it to ssd and play it...other old gen games can still be played on hdd I guess...!!will try and update the review...",5,17/11/20,xbox seriesS,211
"Yes the console is overpriced by 5k, and yes with 5k more you can get PS5 De. Firstly getting a pc with does Raytracing ( RT ) is almost impossible in India, let alone matching the specs & ssd of the console. Coming to PS argument, this console is meant for those who are casual gamers, who have 1080p tv/ monitor, who ain't willing to spend ₹5k for 1 game ( this price may increase as now PS games will cost $70 instead of previous 60 ). Paired with Game Pass ultimate subscription you can play a plethora of games on this powerful little console. Fun fact Game Pass Ultimate cost me 6k for 30 months and it includes Games like Fifa ( included in EA play which is now a part of Game pass ultimate). Note I got the subscription this cheap using the ₹60 promotion ( Buy xbox live gift card from Microsoft Store then use the ₹60 promotion to upgrade all those months of live to Game pass ultimate) Also all first party and xbox publishing games (Ex halo infinite,the medium, starfield etc )will be on Game pass on day one. And all first party games like doom, Gears of war, Halo, fallout, Batman Arkham knight and more games are already on Game pass. The ones who are defaming this powerful little console are either hardcore gamers who spend ₹20k + on games a year or people who are judging this console based on exclusive games. This game is perfect for a middle class man!Edit Quick resume is game changer! With help of it, I don't even encounter loading screens on games i play regularly ( Ac Valhalla in this case ). Also xbox with it's fps boost feature is doubling the frame rates of previous gen games which were locked at 30fps.PS5 doesn't have any counter to Quick resume or Fps boost, although you can obviously play previous gen games with uncap frames. Advice : Going with PC is better only if you can afford a strong PC, also please don't go for gaming laptops. PS5 exclusives like HZD, Death stranding, P4 and more ( Days gone ) are being ported to PC, so if you get a powerful PC you can play exclusive games of both Xbox and PS.If you are on budget then series S + Game pass ultimate is the way to go.",5,14/11/20,xbox seriesS,99
"Just unboxed this beauty. I'll update the review once I get a chance to play games on this.Update: If you are new to console gaming or don't care about 4K etc just go for it. Remember you need to pay 3-4k for a base edition of AAA title. So if you're going to play in a monitor like me and want to try out new games this will be perfect for you. You can play 1080p-2k(mostly 30fps) on a 34k device and for some games you'll also get ray-tracing.** Is it worth? Should I buy a PC instead:If gaming(and netflix, prime video) is what you want to do then just check the prices of a octa core Ryzen cpu and 512GB pcie4 SSD. Also keep in mind that the GPU is based on AMD RDNA2 architecture.** Details:Usable storage 364GB. For reference ASC Valhalla standard edition takes 47GB on XSS(smart delivery).Graphics look awesome on a 24"" 1080p IPS monitor.UI & Opening games are blazing fast thanks to its SSD.Microsoft Game Pass is best deal if you want to play something all the time. It'll probably have few AAA games always available in the list. Currently they have Gears 5, Minecraft, FIFA 2020 etc.Controller is perfect without any ""gimicky"" feature. It has nice haptic feedback too. I personally like offset L and R button.If you're interested in hard-core shooter games then I think any console's controller is not for you.Final verdict: If you want to enjoy few good games on your free times mainly in weekends without compromising features(except 4k) this will perfectly suit you.",5,12/11/20,xbox seriesS,124
"I have preordered it and it will arrive by 15th November.So for everyone’s sake let’s talk about it.PS: this will be my first console so I have no bias for ps or Xbox , I just chose what was best FOR ME.Should you buy it or not.1. The USD to rupee conversion and it costs more in India: it is there for every product that comes from the US, even the iPhone has this disparity. It is clearly because of all the tax n duty. But can you do anything about it? No. Will it change? No. Does ps5 has that issue too? Yes. So let’s stop complaining about something this n accept that this is how it is.2. Is it more powerful then the Xbox one X: yes it is n every aspect, remember that the one X is at least a 5 year old console n the processing power of series S is at par with the series X(the flagship model). The only difference is in terms of resolution and gpu power(the reason being it does not need to do 4K). The series S can display up to 1440p that is 2k at 120fps in some games like gears 5. Majority of the games run at 1080p 60fps and all the games that are make by Xbox or it’s studios will run at 1440p 60fps. Now how many of us have a 4K TV at home. So 1440p is ok for me.3. Remember that digital games are expensive: Like around Rs 4000 per games unless there is a sale. So Xbox has the game pass for that, a Netflix like the monthly subscription which give u more than 100games to play for free. So if u buy ps5 digital then you will have to buy all its exclusive games at rs 4000 as it doesn’t have such subscriptions. So if u want to buy a ps5 , I think buying a disk version is better as u can get disks for cheap.4. I am a working guy and I keep on moving either flats or different city based on my job. N this is so small that I can put it in my bag pack n take it with me like a laptop n plug it into any screen n play.5. Main problem is SSD size or storage. It’s just 364gb. Which is less my friends. So Most of the AAA games like farcry, assassins creed, watch dogs are like 60fb each. N some casual games are like 40gb each. So in a single go you can have 3 big game and 3 casual games at once. Now for me I don’t need more that that . Yes I will buy an external hard disk drive to store my games when I finish them as I don’t want to uninstall them n have the hassle to reinstall them again. I can just transfer games form the hard disk. N how many of you play more than 4games at once . I tend to focus of one game story at a time. But remember big games like Halo n cod are 100gb types so keep that in mind.So if u are ok with the storage problem and is ok with getting an external hard disk later to store games n just do that transfer to and fro whenever u wish to play which will take like 10-15mins to transfer games u r good to go.Also YouTube has make legit gamers who have reviewed this so please go check those out before deciding. As I have done my research n this Xbox series S fit in my budget and needs so I bought it. All I can say is performance won’t be an issue. Rest I suggest do some research before you invest n see if it fits your needs. Hope I helped. Cheers.",4,12/11/20,xbox seriesS,990
"Owning a noise cancelling headset is a 9-year-old dream of mine. I never was able to justify paying 25 to 30k though. Finally, my wife decided to gift me the headset for my birthday. I have read and a lot of reviews for this headset online. All of them are from the perspective of a cell phone user. I use my headset mainly with my laptop and my iPad. Having dual connectivity was a must feature for me because I have a movie or YouTube video playing on my iPad and continue to work on my laptop. I take around 3 to 4 hours of zoom calls on a typical working day so call quality was also a very big priority. Now that you have the back story here are pros and cons.Pros1) Very comfortable. I use them for around 10 to 15 hours a day and I feel a discomfort after having them on for at least 5 hours. I think that is good enough session without taking a break.2) Noise Cancelling – As long as you don’t expect miracles. It does a good job of blocking the fans in my room, my laptop fan, my keyboard noise. If you have a TV on you can still hear it (although at a low volume).3) Connectivity – I didn’t have any issues with the connectivity in the two weeks I have been using this for. Connection was always stable.4) Sound Quality – I am no audiophile. My music source is Apple Music. I am happy with the way my music sounds or twitch steams sounds.Cons1) Call Quality – I am not sure if this is an issue in just my device or if it is a common issue. But, almost every time I take a call on zoom for the first 2 to 3 minutes, it sounds like other persons voice is coming from a tube. I didn’t face this issue while taking calls from phone or iPad. So, I don’t know what exactly is causing this issue but is super annoying to deal with every time.2) Battery Life – Please don’t go by advertised battery life. I never got more than 16 hours. Which is nothing to laugh at and can still last me through a working day and I can charge it once every day.3) APTX – These headphones don’t support APTX or APTX HD. As an IOS and windows user the best I can use these headphones with is AAC which is a bit disappointing. Some of my friends own XM3 and they are super happy with them on windows. My suggestion is if multi connection is not a must for you go for the XM3. They are still a very good headset and they give you excellent call quality on windows.4) Speak to chat – Even after setting the sensitivity to low it gets activated every time I hum the song even very slowly. Good that it can be turned off in the app and I turned it off in the first two days of usage.Despite the cons I love these headphones to bits and pieces. I hope the call quality issue resolves with more burn in or with a software update down the line. I used XM3s, Bose QC 25, 35, 35II and NC 700 (borrowed from my friends). I think these and XM3 have the best audio quality if you a general user. I have no idea about audiophile level details. If your budget permits and you don’t take a lot of calls on windows laptops, I would say go for these.",4,01/11/20,mixed dataset.csv,18
"I am a video editor. This is my first Active Nosie Cancellation(anc) Headphone. And let's review it.PROS:1. Talking about Nosie Cancellation in general: using anc Headphone gives you option to block outside nosie. Which could be looked in other way i.e. you can listen in quite low volume than you used to.With anc off I am listening to  about 50-60% volume with anc on its 20-30%.At the end of day your ear are much pleased and relaxed which is big thing as next day I have repeat the same.2. EQ : app has several EQ to suit different people and their different needs.And it's very easy to tweak EQ.I love flat EQ. It helps in two ways.A. Reduce listening fatigue. I use headphone 8-10 hrs and end of day I don't feel listening fatigue.I haven't have used any I repeat any headphone which not cause listening fatigue. (Listening fatigue is different from headphone clamp force)B. As video editor I do need everything in its very neutral state. And then tweak from there. So yes this is amazing.3. I used various headphone and earphone but haven't listened to anything which match it's sound quality.People talk about track seperation. You could realise with this headphone for sure.4. App is so good. People don't talk about app. It's really good and ease to use.5. Dsse extreme : It do work. It improve person talking.6. Controls : touch feels more fresh and practical as you don't look/feel for right button but there are time when you hear chime and it don't do anything.I find Google assistant works great. You can say to assistant to change to next/prev song or volume% or pause. It's super fast not like you take 2 secs and assistant think and repeat your sentence. You say, release assistant button and it's done.Plus you can do all with just a single button and as I am right handed mostly my hand is occupied with mouse or pen hence busy.And control is on right side. And assistant button on left side. If you think to invert sides it changes how next and previous work.7. Auto power off and music pause  : I find this feature so useful. I hardly turn off the Headphone.Even auto pause is really good. It not work for vlc or premiere.8. Granual volume adjustable : there are time when you listen to specific volume. Like 25% not 20 or 30 it's possible. Both touch control and assistant.It may not look much but those small things make you listen you hours and don't feel fatigue at all.CONS and Feature request:1. Any anc Headphone would create a pressure in your ear. It's called cabin pressure. It's like sucking you ear with a less power vacuum cleaner.Hope it could be reduced.2. This headphone do cause heat around your ear. Well removing headphone for a minute would fix that.3. Sweat problem is for real. Its told in youtube reviews. But many headphone do cause sweat problem....again remove, clean and wear again.Both heat and sweat problem gonna have their real test in summers.4. I had expected anc to be top notch. Don't get me wrong but as first anc I expect too much. Think anc as volume reducer.I can still listen fan and some other noise.Look I am video editor and my ear had trained in a way to listen sort of sound. So anc could depend from person to personBut if you play a music at 20-25% it do reduce outside noise quite a lot.5. Battery life : company claim it's 30hrs with anc on and 50% volume.My anc is always on and I listen in 20-30% volume maybe reach to 40% as well time to time.But I have to charge every 2 day. It's like 16-20hrs battery life.I got first one replaced but second one is isn't getting any close to even 25hrs.I don't have problem with every 2 day charge. It's pretty good to me. But not matching company's standard.6. Bluetooth sometime do stutter. Turn off and now mostly fix it. But I need fixing c'mon sony.7. Hope we can use Google assistant to toggle noise cancellation and different EQ.8. Customizing option for custom button. You can make your own fav function to have.Verdict : If you someone who have to work for hours on computer or feel outside nosie act as distraction for you, you work music or video editing this would serve its purpose for sure. And yes also for travel enthusiast.Wear Headphone for 5+ hour to feel comfortable.Headphone won't cause pain in ear. But cabin pressure and heat and sweat are problematic. It won't cause headache to me. Maybe if you listen to few hrs it would make you adjusted for that.Sound is amazing. Comfort is great so does anc but those could be further improved.Look no headphone I had used in past which could match it's comfort. I actually wear for 8-10 hrs each day. Well who doesn't need more improved products.",4,18/10/20,mixed dataset.csv,58
"Update: (Mar 9, 2021)As someone mentioned above, I too started having tinnitus issues only after wearing these headphones. I was under impression that it might be due to cold weather or something else but it seems many people are facing similar issues with ANC headphones. I would also like to mention that I had COVID-19 earlier and tinnitus might be a post symptom from it.Initial 12hrs usage impressions: (Sep 20, 2020)Super comfortable.I am not an audiophile but these sounds amazing.ANC is great (tested indoors as of now).Dual device connection is also great.Great connection range.Speak to Chat works great but it has some obvious issues (something you need to get used to).Ambient Sound is also nice.Update:ANC cancels out the vehicular traffic sounds as well (horn sounds, movement), a bit dangerous considering you are planning to take a walk/run sideways. You can tweak the ANC settings via the Sony ANC app.Speak to chat can be finicky at times, there is a slight delay of 2secs. Sometimes it just fails to recognise and sometimes it gets triggered without speaking anything.My suggestion to buyers, don't go by the online reviews, it might be a good purchase for me but not for everyone. Try them out at some retail store before buying. I might update this when I have something more to share.",5,20/09/20,mixed dataset.csv,222
"Update sept 26Got the replacement set and they sound do much better than the first ones I recieved. This kind of issues is unheard of from a product that costs 30k not gonna lie. Seriosuly? A defective pair of headphones ? Unexpected sony !Update- sept-25So I was  using these like.usual when I started hearing a shrill noise from the right side earcup! Tried it with multiple devices , persistsnt shrill noise with noise cancelion and no music( my room's fan was off ) . Replacing for a new pair . Will updateI'm not a ""audiophile"" but I've tested and heard many headphones/earphones in search of the ""perfect"" pair of cans for me. Perfect is a subjective term and will vary from person to person.I bought these becasue of all the hype with the xm3's and as a customer the ""next"" version would obviously be better right ?So, come delivery day. I ooened these, set them up, updated the firmware and started listening . These sound , ok. For something that costs 30k, these sound average at best. The noice cancelling is good but I need to test it more , possibly on an airplane ( whenever that happens )When something is this expensive you automatically have some expectations from it right ? It has to perform at the 30k level ( I hope the reader is getting what I'm trying to say) .The software features are great , the build feels premium, the connection is strong.P.S if you intend to use the multipoint function you will loose audio quality . LDAC uses two lanes ( max for bluetooth 5.0) and when you use multipoint it switches to SBC ( 1 lane ) so expect quality loss. Windows doesn't support LDAC so you will loose significant quality when connected to a pc.I'll update the review after the burn in period . I won't be returning these since these are just too damn comfortable but doesn't justify the 30k price tag it demands for the sound quality I'm getting as of 20 sept.",4,20/09/20,mixed dataset.csv,259
